Imagine you're deploying a service that condenses emails into concise summaries. One challenge of using LLMs for summarization is that even the best models can miscategorize key details, or miss those details entirely.

In this tutorial, you will construct a dataset and run experiments to engineer a prompt template that produces accurately summarizes your emails. You will:

* Upload a **dataset** of **examples** containing emails to Phoenix
* Define an **experiment task** that extracts and formats the key details from those emails
* Devise an **evaluator** measuring Jaro-Winkler Similarity
* Run **experiments** to iterate on your prompt template and to compare the summaries produced by different LLMs

## Notebook Walkthrough

We will go through key code snippets on this page. To follow the full tutorial, check out the Colab notebook above.

## Instrument LangChain and OpenAI

First, we need to set up our instrumentors to capture traces from the agent. Since our task runs through LangChain but the evaluation function calls OpenAI directly, weâ€™ll enable both the Langchain and OpenAI auto-instrumentors.&#x20;

```python
from openinference.instrumentation.langchain import LangChainInstrumentor
from openinference.instrumentation.openai import OpenAIInstrumentor

tracer_provider = register(endpoint="your-endpoint-here", auto_instrument = True)
```

## Experiments in Phoenix

Experiments in Phoenix are made up of 3 elements: a dataset, a task, and an evaluator. The dataset is a collection of the inputs and expected outputs that we'll use to evaluate. The task is an operation that should be performed on each input. Finally, the evaluator compares the result against an expected output.

For this example, here's what each looks like:

* **Dataset:** a dataframe of emails to analyze, and the expected output for our agent
* **Task**: a Langchain agent that extracts key info from our input emails. The result of this task will then be compared against the expected output
* **Evaluator**: Jaro-Winkler distance calculation on the task's output and expected output

### Dataset

We've prepared some example emails and actual responses that we can use to evaluate our two models. Let's download those and save them to a temporary file. Then, we will upload the dataset to Phoenix.&#x20;

```python
dataset_name = "Email Extraction"

with tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile(suffix=".json") as f:
    download_public_dataset(registry[dataset_name].dataset_id, path=f.name)
    df = pd.read_json(f.name)[["inputs", "outputs"]]
df = df.sample(10, random_state=42)
```

```python
dataset = px.Client().upload_dataset(
    dataset_name=f"{dataset_name}{datetime.now(timezone.utc)}",
    inputs=df.inputs,
    outputs=df.outputs.map(lambda obj: obj["output"]),
)
```

The picture below shows how your dataset examples will appear in the Phoenix UI.&#x20;

### Create LangChain Agent and Define Task Function

Now we'll set up our Langchain agent. This is a straightforward agent that makes a call to our specified model and formats the response as JSON.

```python
model = "gpt-4o"

llm = ChatOpenAI(model=model).bind_functions(
    functions=[registry[dataset_name].schema],
    function_call=registry[dataset_name].schema.schema()["title"],
)
output_parser = JsonOutputFunctionsParser()
extraction_chain = registry[dataset_name].instructions | llm | output_parser
```

Next, we need to define a Task for our experiment to use.

```python
def task(input) -> str:
    return extraction_chain.invoke(input)
```

### Run Experiment

```python
experiment = run_experiment(dataset, task)
```

### Evaluate Experiment

Finally, we need to define our evaluation function. Here we'll use a Jaro-Winkler similarity function that generates a score for how similar the output and expected text are. [Jaro-Winkler similarity](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FJaro%25E2%2580%2593Winkler_distance) is technique for measuring edit distance between two strings.

```python
def jarowinkler_similarity(output, expected) -> float:
    return jarowinkler.jarowinkler_similarity(
        json.dumps(output, sort_keys=True),
        json.dumps(expected, sort_keys=True),
    )

evaluate_experiment(experiment, jarowinkler_similarity)
```

## Re-run with GPT 3.5 Turbo and Compare Results

Now we have scores on how well GPT-4o does at extracting email facts. This is helpful, but doesn't mean much on its own. Let's compare it against another model.

To compare results with another model, we simply need to redefine our task. Our dataset and evaluator can stay the same.

```python
model = "gpt-3.5-turbo"

llm = ChatOpenAI(model=model).bind_functions(
    functions=[registry[dataset_name].schema],
    function_call=registry[dataset_name].schema.schema()["title"],
)
extraction_chain = registry[dataset_name].instructions | llm | output_parser
```

```python
def task(input) -> str:
    return extraction_chain.invoke(input)
    
experiment = run_experiment(dataset, task)

evaluate_experiment(experiment, jarowinkler_similarity)
```

## View Results

Now if you check your Phoenix experiment, you can compare Jaro-Winkler scores on a per query basis, and view aggregate model performance results. The experiment comparison screenshot below shows results from GPT-4o on the left and GPT-3.5-turbo on the far right. The higher the jarowinkler\_similarity score, the closer the outputted value is to the actual value.

You should see that GPT-4o outperforms its older cousin.

From here you could try out different models or iterate on your prompt, then run the same experiment with a modified Task to compare results.
