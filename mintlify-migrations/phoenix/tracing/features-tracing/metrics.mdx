Traces that are sent to a project are automatically indexed for metrics. This lets you quickly identify areas of poor performance. The project metrics dashboard includes:

- Trace latency and errors
- Latency Quantiles
- Annotation Scores Timeseries
- Cost over Time by token type
- Top Models by Cost
- Token Usage by token type
- Top Models by Tokens
- LLM Invocation and Errors
- Tool calls and Errors
