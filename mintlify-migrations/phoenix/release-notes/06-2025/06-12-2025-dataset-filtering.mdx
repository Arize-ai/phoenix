This release enables filtering of datasets by name across both the API and user interface, integrating a live search input along with support for pagination and sorting to improve data navigation and usability.

* Added a `DatasetFilter` input and enum to the GraphQL schema, allowing users to filter datasets by name using case-insensitive matching.
* Created a debounced `DatasetsSearch` component on the Datasets page that lets users filter results live as they type.
