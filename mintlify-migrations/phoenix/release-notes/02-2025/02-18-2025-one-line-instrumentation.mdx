Phoenix has made it even simpler to get started with tracing by introducing one-line auto-instrumentation. By using `register(auto_instrument=True)`, you can enable automatic instrumentation in your application, which will set up instrumentors based on your installed packages.

```python
from phoenix.otel import register

register(auto_instrument=True)
```

For more details, you can check the docs and explore further [tracing](/phoenix/tracing/how-to-tracing/setup-tracing) options.
