description: How to create Phoenix inferences and schemas for the corpus data

In [Information Retrieval](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_retrieval), a document is any piece of information the user may want to retrieve, e.g. a paragraph, an article, or a Web page, and a collection of documents is referred to as the corpus. A corpus can provide the knowledge base (of proprietary data) for supplementing a user query in the prompt context to a Large Language Model (LLM) in the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) use case. Relevant documents are first [retrieved](/phoenix/inferences/how-to-inferences/define-your-schema/retrieval-rag) based on the user query and its embedding, then the retrieved documents are combined with the query to construct an augmented prompt for the LLM to provide a more accurate response incorporating information from the knowledge base. Corpus inferences can be imported into Phoenix as shown below.

## Inferences

Below is an example dataframe containing Wikipedia articles along with its embedding vector.

| id | text                                              | embedding                                          |
| -- | ------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |

## Schema

Below is an appropriate schema for the dataframe above. It specifies the `id` column and that `embedding` belongs to `text`. Other columns, if exist, will be detected automatically, and need not be specified by the schema.

```py
corpus_schema = px.Schema(
    id_column_name="id",
    document_column_names=EmbeddingColumnNames(
        vector_column_name="embedding",
        raw_data_column_name="text",
    ),
)
```

## Inferences

Define the inferences by pairing the dataframe with the schema.

```js
corpus_inferences = px.Inferences(corpus_dataframe, corpus_schema)
```

## Application

The [application](/phoenix/inferences/how-to-inferences/manage-the-app#launch-the-app) launcher accepts the corpus dataset through `corpus=` parameter.

```js
session = px.launch_app(production_dataset, corpus=corpus_inferences)
```
