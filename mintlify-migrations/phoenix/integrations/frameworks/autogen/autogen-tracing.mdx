title: "AutoGen Tracing"

AutoGen is an agent framework from Microsoft that allows for complex Agent creation. It is unique in its ability to create multiple agents that work together.

The AutoGen Agent framework allows creation of multiple agents and connection of those agents to work together to accomplish tasks.

## Launch Phoenix

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Phoenix Cloud">
    **Sign up for Phoenix:**

    1. Sign up for an Arize Phoenix account at [https://app.phoenix.arize.com/login](https://app.phoenix.arize.com/login)

    2. Click `Create Space`, then follow the prompts to create and launch your space.

    **Install packages:**

    ``` bash
    pip install arize-phoenix-otel
    ```

    **Set your Phoenix endpoint and API Key:**

    From your new Phoenix Space

    1. Create your API key from the Settings page

    2. Copy your `Hostname` from the Settings page

    3. In your code, set your endpoint and API key:

    ```python
    import os

    os.environ["PHOENIX_API_KEY"] = "ADD YOUR PHOENIX API KEY"
    os.environ["PHOENIX_COLLECTOR_ENDPOINT"] = "ADD YOUR PHOENIX HOSTNAME"

    # If you created your Phoenix Cloud instance before June 24th, 2025,
    # you also need to set the API key as a header:
    # os.environ["PHOENIX_CLIENT_HEADERS"] = f"api_key={os.getenv('PHOENIX_API_KEY')}"
    ```

    </Info>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Command Line">
    **Launch your local Phoenix instance:**

    ``` bash
    pip install arize-phoenix
    phoenix serve
    ```

    For details on customizing a local terminal deployment, see [Terminal Setup](https://arize.com/docs/phoenix/setup/environments#terminal).

    **Install packages:**

    ``` bash
    pip install arize-phoenix-otel
    ```

    **Set your Phoenix endpoint:**

    ```javascript
    import os

    os.environ["PHOENIX_COLLECTOR_ENDPOINT"] = "http://localhost:6006"
    ```

    See [Terminal](https://arize.com/docs/phoenix/environments#terminal) for more details.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Docker">
    **Pull latest Phoenix image from** [**Docker Hub**](https://hub.docker.com/r/arizephoenix/phoenix)**:**

    ```bash
    docker pull arizephoenix/phoenix:latest
    ```

    **Run your containerized instance:**

    ```bash
    docker run -p 6006:6006 arizephoenix/phoenix:latest
    ```

    This will expose the Phoenix on `localhost:6006`

    **Install packages:**

    ``` bash
    pip install arize-phoenix-otel
    ```

    **Set your Phoenix endpoint:**

    ```javascript
    import os

    os.environ["PHOENIX_COLLECTOR_ENDPOINT"] = "http://localhost:6006"
    ```

    For more info on using Phoenix with Docker, see [Docker](https://arize.com/docs/phoenix/self-hosting/deployment-options/docker).
  </Tab>
    <Tab title="Notebook">
    **Install packages:**

    ``` bash
    pip install arize-phoenix
    ```

    **Launch Phoenix:**

    ```javascript
    import phoenix as px
    px.launch_app()
    ```

    <Info>
    By default, notebook instances do not have persistent storage, so your traces will disappear after the notebook is closed. See [self-hosting](https://arize.com/docs/phoenix/self-hosting) or use one of the other deployment options to retain traces.

## Install

Phoenix instruments Autogen by instrumenting the underlying model library it's using. If your agents are set up to call OpenAI, use our OpenAI instrumentor per the example below.

If your agents are using a different model, be sure to instrument that model instead by installing its respective OpenInference library.

```bash
pip install openinference-instrumentation-openai arize-phoenix-otel arize-phoenix
```

## Setup

Connect to your Phoenix instance using the register function.

```python
from phoenix.otel import register

# configure the Phoenix tracer
tracer_provider = register(
  project_name="my-llm-app", # Default is 'default'
  auto_instrument=True # Auto-instrument your app based on installed OI dependencies
)
```

## Run Autogen

From here you can use Autogen as normal, and Phoenix will automatically trace any model calls made.

## Observe

The Phoenix support is simple in its first incarnation but allows for capturing all of the prompt and responses that occur under the framework between each agent.

The individual prompt and responses are captured directly through OpenAI calls. If you're using a different underlying model provider than OpenAI, instrument your application using the respective instrumentor instead.
