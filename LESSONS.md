# Lessons Learned During Dataset Upsert Rollout

Use this file to capture non-obvious findings while executing the plan.

## When to add an entry
- You discover something surprising about behavior, architecture, tooling, or tests.
- You hit an unexpected failure mode, edge case, or migration concern.
- You identify something problematic (design risk, maintainability issue, performance concern).

## Entry format
Add one section per finding:

### YYYY-MM-DD — STEP-XX — Short title
- Category: `surprising` | `unexpected` | `problematic`
- Context: where this occurred (file/area/test).
- Observation: what was found.
- Impact: why it matters.
- Action taken: what changed (or why deferred).
- Follow-up: optional next step or open question.
