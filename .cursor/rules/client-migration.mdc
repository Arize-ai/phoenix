## Client Migration

The `arize-phoenix` package consists of a sub-package named `arize-phoenix-client` which has the full functionality to communicate to the phoenix server. There is a legacy client exported at the top level of the `arize-phoenix` package that is being deprecated. Here are some common patterns that are legacy.

## Legacy Patterns

```python
import phoenix as px

client = px.Client()
```

## Correct Pattherns

```python
from phoenix.client import Client
```

```python
from phoenix.client import AsyncClient
```

## Experiments Migration

### Legacy Pattern

```python
from phoenix.experiments import run_experiment
```

### Correct Pattern

```python
from phoenix.client.experiments import run_experiment
```

## Datasets Migration


## Log Evaluation Migration (For Span Evaluations)

### Before
```python
client.log_evaluations(
    SpanEvaluations(
        dataframe=relevance_df,
        eval_name="Recommendation Relevance",
    ),
)
```

### After
```python
client.annotations.log_span_annotations_dataframe(
    dataframe=relevance_df,
    annotation_name="Recommendation Relevance",
    annotator_kind="LLM",
)
```
