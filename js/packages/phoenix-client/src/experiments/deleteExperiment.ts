 * - Deletes the experiment and all its data
 * - Returns successfully if experiment is found and deleted
 * - Throws error if experiment is not found (404) or other errors occur
 *
 * @param params - The parameters to delete an experiment
 * @returns Promise that resolves when the experiment is successfully deleted
 * @throws Error if the experiment is not found or deletion fails
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * import { deleteExperiment } from "@arizeai/phoenix-client/experiments";
 *
 * await deleteExperiment({
 *   experimentId: "exp_123",
 * });
 * ```
