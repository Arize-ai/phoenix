These reactions occur in the stroma , the fluid-filled area of a chloroplast outside of the thylakoid membranes. These reactions take the light-dependent reactions and perform further chemical processes on them. There are three phases to the light-independent reactions, collectively called the Calvin cycle : carbon fixation, reduction reactions, and ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate (RuBP) regeneration. Despite its name, this process occurs only when light is available. Plants do not carry out the Calvin cycle by night. They, instead, release sucrose into the phloem from their starch reserves. This process happens when light is available independent of the kind of photosynthesis ( C3 carbon fixation , C4 carbon fixation , and Crassulacean Acid Metabolism ); CAM plants store malic acid in their vacuoles every night and release it by day in order to make this process work.",

Nothing is known for certain about the original language or languages of the Philistines, however they were not part of the Semitic Canaanite population.

Assets , liabilities and ownership equity are listed as of a specific date, such as the end of its financial year . A balance sheet is often described as a \"snapshot of a company's financial condition\". Of the four basic financial statements , the balance sheet is the only statement which applies to a single point in time of a business' calendar year. A standard company balance sheet has three parts: assets, liabilities and ownership equity. The main categories of assets are usually listed first, and typically in order of liquidity . Assets are followed by the liabilities. The difference between the assets and the liabilities is known as equity or the net assets or the net worth or capital of the company and according to the accounting equation , net worth must equal assets minus liabilities. Another way to look at the same equation is that assets equals liabilities plus owner's equity. Looking at the equation in this way shows how assets were financed: either by borrowing money (liability) or by using the owner's money (owner's equity). Balance sheets are usually presented with assets in one section and liabilities and net worth in the other section with the two sections \"balancing.\" A business operating entirely in cash can measure its profits by withdrawing the entire bank balance at the end of the period, plus any cash in hand. However, many businesses are not paid immediately; they build up inventories of goods and they acquire buildings and equipment. In other words: businesses have assets and so they cannot, even if they want to, immediately turn these into cash at the end of each period. Often, these businesses owe money to suppliers and to tax authorities, and the proprietors do not withdraw all their original capital and profits at the end of each period.

Played by official softball rules, the game was seen by an overflow record crowd of 8,918, and was won by the Bandits 4-2. In 1999, the Flyers hired their first manager, Ron Kittle . Kittle is best known for his playing days with the Chicago White Sox , and former Chicago Cubs and White Sox player Greg Hibbard was the pitching coach. During the early years of the franchise, Kittle did a series of TV commercials to promote the team, using the gimmick "Ma Kittle." where he played both himself and his "Ma." The ads were successful at sparking some initial interest in the team as the Flyers hoped to steal away fans from the nearby Kane County Cougars . The ad mimicked the highly successful Converse ads where Larry Johnson starred as both himself and "Gramama." At the end of the 2001 season, however, Kittle resigned from his managerial position, and Jim Boynewicz was hired to replace him. In 2004, the Flyers made it to the Northern League Championship Series against the St. Paul Saints . Despite leading the five-game series 2-1, Schaumburg eventually lost the series. In Game 5, Flyers relief pitcher Lyle Prempas allowed a game winning grand slam by St. Paul infielder Marc Mirizzi in the ninth inning.

He played a critical role in the events that led to the demise of the Roman Republic and the rise of the Roman Empire . In 60 BC, Caesar, Crassus and Pompey formed a political alliance that was to dominate Roman politics for several years. Their attempts to amass power through populist tactics were opposed by the conservative elite within the Roman Senate , among them Cato the Younger with the frequent support of Cicero . Caesar's conquest of Gaul , completed by 51 BC, extended Rome's territory to the English Channel and the Rhine . Caesar became the first Roman general to cross both when he built a bridge across the Rhine and conducted the first invasion of Britain . These achievements granted him unmatched military power and threatened to eclipse the standing of Pompey, who had realigned himself with the Senate after the death of Crassus in 53 BC. With the Gallic Wars concluded, the Senate ordered Caesar to lay down his military command and return to Rome. Caesar refused, and marked his defiance in 49 BC by crossing the Rubicon with a legion , leaving his province and illegally entering Roman territory under arms. Civil war resulted, from which he emerged as the unrivaled leader of Rome. After assuming control of government, Caesar began a program of social and governmental reforms, including the creation of the Julian calendar . He centralised the bureaucracy of the Republic and was eventually proclaimed \"dictator in perpetuity\". But the underlying political conflicts had not been resolved, and on the Ides of March (15 March) 44 BC, Caesar was assassinated by a group of senators led by Marcus Junius Brutus . A new series of civil wars broke out, and the constitutional government of the Republic was never restored. Caesar's adopted heir Octavian, later known as Augustus , rose to sole power, and the era of the Roman Empire began. Much of Caesar's life is known from his own accounts of his military campaigns, and from other contemporary sources, mainly the letters and speeches of Cicero and the historical writings of Sallust . The later biographies of Caesar by Suetonius and Plutarch are also major sources. Caesar is deemed to be one of the greatest military commanders of history .",

The somatosensory system is a diverse sensory system comprising the receptors and processing centres to produce the sensory modalities such as touch, temperature , proprioception (body position), and nociception (pain). The sensory receptors cover the skin and epithelia , skeletal muscles , bones and joints , internal organs , and the cardiovascular system . While touch is considered one of the five traditional senses , the impression of touch is formed from several modalities. In medicine, the colloquial term "touch" is usually replaced with "somatic senses" to better reflect the variety of mechanisms involved. Somatic senses are sometimes referred to as somesthetic senses, with the understanding that somesthesis includes touch, proprioception and (depending on usage) also haptic perception. The system reacts to diverse stimuli using different receptors: thermoreceptors , nociceptors , mechanoreceptors and chemoreceptors . Transmission of information from the receptors passes via sensory nerves through tracts in the spinal cord and into the brain. Processing primarily occurs in the primary somatosensory area in the parietal lobe of the cerebral cortex . The cortical homunculus was devised by Wilder Penfield . At its simplest, the system works when activity in a sensory neuron is triggered by a specific stimulus such as heat; this signal eventually passes to an area in the brain uniquely attributed to that area on the body‚Äîthis allows the processed stimulus to be felt at the correct location. The point-to-point mapping of the body surfaces in the brain is called a homunculus and is essential in the creation of a body image . This brain-surface ("cortical") map is not immutable, however.

    documentText:
      'A use tax in United States is complementary to sales tax which means, if you buy a Taxable product/services without paying any Sales tax to vendor, you owe use tax. You must self assess use tax and pay it directly to the state where the products were consumed or services were rendered. Use tax typically is a tax on consumption but if you buy an item (without paying sales tax) and store it in your warehouse initially, use tax applies to that location where goods were stored. Later on when the final consumption takes place at some other location, you are required to pay the differential of tax rate to the jurisdiction of ultimate place of consumption. This really means that you don\'t have to pay both Sales Tax as well as Use Tax on one transaction. It is only one or the other that you are required to pay on purchase of taxable products/services. If vendor doesn\'t charge any Sales tax on its invoice then it is the obligation of the buyer to self assess Use tax and pay it to the appropriate Jurisdication. Use Tax is generally charged at the same tax rate of Sales Tax but in some states the tax rate is different. Use tax is also termed as "Consumption Tax" or "Con...',

      'right right Sanuk, a division of Deckers Outdoor Corporation , is a footwear brand based in Southern California . Sanuk, the Thai word for fun, was founded by Southern California native Jeff Kelley when he started making sandals out of indoor-outdoor carpet . The first product created was green carpeted and entitled the "Fur Real" after one shop owner asked if the novelty sandal was "For Real." The Fur Real first became a runaway hit through boutique stores and not the intended surf shops . The novelty act was followed up by a sandal wrapped in wire mesh, a leopard print version, and styles made out of a poncho material in a variety of colors. Sanuk has grown to include style options for men, women and youth and is distributed across the United States and in over 50 countries throughout Europe , Asia , South America and Australia . Sanuk centers itself around a positive lifestyle advocating the slogan, "Smile,Pass it on!".',

    documentText:
      "The Era of Good Feelings marked a period in the political history of the United States that reflected a sense of national purpose and a desire for unity among Americans in the aftermath of the Napoleonic Wars . The era saw the collapse of the Federalist Party and an end to the bitter partisan disputes between it and the dominant Democratic-Republican party during the First Party System . President James Monroe endeavored to downplay partisan affiliation in making his nominations, with the ultimate goal of national unity and eliminating parties altogether from national politics. The period is so closely associated with Monroe's presidency (1817‚Äì1825) and his administrative goals that his name and the era are virtually synonymous. The Era of Good Feelings marked a transition in American politics with the end of the Federalist Party as America began to develop after the War of 1812. While America was experiencing growth and prosperity after the war with Britain, this era also marks the first instance of economic troubles in the growing United States. Mirroring the American System proposed by Henry Clay, protective tariffs and the chartering of th...",
