title: "MCP Tracing"
description: Phoenix provides tracing for MCP clients and servers through OpenInference. This includes the unique capability to trace client to server interactions under a single trace in the correct hierarchy.
---

The `openinference-instrumentation-mcp` instrumentor is unique compared to other OpenInference instrumentors. It does not generate any of its own telemetry. Instead, it enables context propagation between MCP clients and servers to unify traces. **You still need generate OpenTelemetry traces in both the client and server to see a unified trace.**

Phoenix Cloud

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Phoenix Cloud">
    **Sign up for Phoenix:**

    1. Sign up for an Arize Phoenix account at [https://app.phoenix.arize.com/login](https://app.phoenix.arize.com/login)

    2. Click `Create Space`, then follow the prompts to create and launch your space.

    **Install packages:**

    ``` bash
    pip install arize-phoenix-otel
    ```

    **Set your Phoenix endpoint and API Key:**

    From your new Phoenix Space

    1. Create your API key from the Settings page

    2. Copy your `Hostname` from the Settings page

    3. In your code, set your endpoint and API key:

    ```python
    import os

    os.environ["PHOENIX_API_KEY"] = "ADD YOUR PHOENIX API KEY"
    os.environ["PHOENIX_COLLECTOR_ENDPOINT"] = "ADD YOUR PHOENIX HOSTNAME"

    # If you created your Phoenix Cloud instance before June 24th, 2025,
    # you also need to set the API key as a header:
    # os.environ["PHOENIX_CLIENT_HEADERS"] = f"api_key={os.getenv('PHOENIX_API_KEY')}"
    ```

  <Tab title="Command Line">
    **Launch your local Phoenix instance:**

    ``` bash
    pip install arize-phoenix
    phoenix serve
    ```

    For details on customizing a local terminal deployment, see [Terminal Setup](https://arize.com/docs/phoenix/setup/environments#terminal).

    **Install packages:**

    ``` bash
    pip install arize-phoenix-otel
    ```

    **Set your Phoenix endpoint:**

    ```javascript
    import os

    os.environ["PHOENIX_COLLECTOR_ENDPOINT"] = "http://localhost:6006"
    ```

    See [Terminal](https://arize.com/docs/phoenix/environments#terminal) for more details.

  <Tab title="Docker">
    **Pull latest Phoenix image from** [**Docker Hub**](https://hub.docker.com/r/arizephoenix/phoenix)**:**

    ```bash
    docker pull arizephoenix/phoenix:latest
    ```

    **Run your containerized instance:**

    ```bash
    docker run -p 6006:6006 arizephoenix/phoenix:latest
    ```

    This will expose the Phoenix on `localhost:6006`

    **Install packages:**

    ``` bash
    pip install arize-phoenix-otel
    ```

    **Set your Phoenix endpoint:**

    ```javascript
    import os

    os.environ["PHOENIX_COLLECTOR_ENDPOINT"] = "http://localhost:6006"
    ```

    <Tab title="Notebook">
    **Install packages:**

    ``` bash
    pip install arize-phoenix
    ```

    **Launch Phoenix:**

    ```javascript
    import phoenix as px
    px.launch_app()
    ```

    <Info>
    By default, notebook instances do not have persistent storage, so your traces will disappear after the notebook is closed. See [self-hosting](https://arize.com/docs/phoenix/self-hosting) or use one of the other deployment options to retain traces.

## Install

```bash
pip install openinference-instrumentation-mcp
```

<Warning>
Because the MCP instrumentor does not generate its own telemetry, you must use it alongside other instrumentation code to see traces.

</Warning>

The example code below uses OpenAI agents, which you can instrument using:

```bash
pip install openinference-instrumentation-openai_agents
```

## Add Tracing to your MCP Client

```python
import asyncio

from agents import Agent, Runner
from agents.mcp import MCPServer, MCPServerStdio
from dotenv import load_dotenv

from phoenix.otel import register

load_dotenv()

# Connect to your Phoenix instance
tracer_provider = register(auto_instrument=True)


async def run(mcp_server: MCPServer):
    agent = Agent(
        name="Assistant",
        instructions="Use the tools to answer the users question.",
        mcp_servers=[mcp_server],
    )
    while True:
        message = input("\n\nEnter your question (or 'exit' to quit): ")
        if message.lower() == "exit" or message.lower() == "q":
            break
        print(f"\n\nRunning: {message}")
        result = await Runner.run(starting_agent=agent, input=message)
        print(result.final_output)


async def main():
    async with MCPServerStdio(
        name="Financial Analysis Server",
        params={
            "command": "fastmcp",
            "args": ["run", "./server.py"],
        },
        client_session_timeout_seconds=30,
    ) as server:
        await run(server)
        
if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

### Add Tracing to your MCP Server

```ruby
import json
import os
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

import openai
from dotenv import load_dotenv
from mcp.server.fastmcp import FastMCP
from pydantic import BaseModel

from phoenix.otel import register

load_dotenv()

# You must also connect your MCP server to Phoenix
tracer_provider = register(auto_instrument=True)

# Get a tracer to add additional instrumentattion
tracer = tracer_provider.get_tracer("financial-analysis-server")

# Configure OpenAI client
client = openai.OpenAI(api_key=os.environ.get("OPENAI_API_KEY"))
MODEL = "gpt-4-turbo"

# Create MCP server
mcp = FastMCP("Financial Analysis Server")


class StockAnalysisRequest(BaseModel):
    ticker: str
    time_period: str = "short-term"  # short-term, medium-term, long-term


@mcp.tool()
@tracer.tool(name="MCP.analyze_stock") # this OpenInference call adds tracing to this method
def analyze_stock(request: StockAnalysisRequest) -> dict:
    """Analyzes a stock based on its ticker symbol and provides investment recommendations."""

    # Make LLM API call to analyze the stock
    prompt = f"""
    Provide a detailed financial analysis for the stock ticker: {request.ticker}
    Time horizon: {request.time_period}

    Please include:
    1. Company overview
    2. Recent financial performance
    3. Key metrics (P/E ratio, market cap, etc.)
    4. Risk assessment
    5. Investment recommendation

    Format your response as a JSON object with the following structure:
    {{
        "ticker": "{request.ticker}",
        "company_name": "Full company name",
        "overview": "Brief company description",
        "financial_performance": "Analysis of recent performance",
        "key_metrics": {{
            "market_cap": "Value in billions",
            "pe_ratio": "Current P/E ratio",
            "dividend_yield": "Current yield percentage",
            "52_week_high": "Value",
            "52_week_low": "Value"
        }},
        "risk_assessment": "Analysis of risks",
        "recommendation": "Buy/Hold/Sell recommendation with explanation",
        "time_horizon": "{request.time_period}"
    }}
    """

    response = client.chat.completions.create(
        model=MODEL,
        messages=[{"role": "user", "content": prompt}],
        response_format={"type": "json_object"},
    )

    analysis = json.loads(response.choices[0].message.content)
    return analysis

# ... define any additional MCP tools you wish

if __name__ == "__main__":
    mcp.run()
```

## Observe

Now that you have tracing setup, all invocations of your client and server will be streamed to Phoenix for observability and evaluation, and connected in the platform.
