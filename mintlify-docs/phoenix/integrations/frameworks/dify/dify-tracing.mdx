## Launch Phoenix

The fastest way to get started with Phoenix is by signing up for a [free Phoenix Cloud account](https://app.arize.com/auth/phoenix/signup). If you prefer, you can also run Phoenix in a [notebook](/phoenix/environments#notebooks), [self-host it](/phoenix/environments#container), or use it directly from your [terminal](/phoenix/environments#terminal).

#### Get your API Key and Endpoint

Go to the settings page in your Phoenix instance to find your endpoint and API key.

## Connect Dify and Phoenix

To configure Phoenix tracing in your Dify application:

1. Open the Dify application you want to monitor.

2. In the left sidebar, navigate to **Monitoring**.

3. On the Monitoring page, select Phoenix in the Tracing drop down to begin setup.

4. Enter your Phoenix credentials and save. You can verify the monitoring status on the current page.
