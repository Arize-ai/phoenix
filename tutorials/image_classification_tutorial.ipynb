    "1. What does the Euclidean distance graph measure?\n",
    "1. What do the points in the point cloud represent?\n",
    "1. What do you notice about the cluster you selected?\n",

    "### Answers\n",
    "\n",
    "1. This graph measures the drift of your production data relative to your training data over time.\n",
    "1. Each point in the point cloud corresponds to an image. Phoenix has taken the high-dimensional embeddings in your original DataFrame and has reduced the dimensionality so that you can view them in lower dimensions.\n",
    "1. It consists almost entirely of production data, meaning that your model is seeing data in production the likes of which it never saw during training.\n",
    "1. Your model was trained crisp and high-resolution images. In production, your model is encountering blurry and noisy images that it cannot correctly classify.\n",
