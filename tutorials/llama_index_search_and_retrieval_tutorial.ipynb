    "Imagine you're an engineer at Arize AI and you've built and deployed a documentation question-answering service using LlamaIndex. Users send questions about Arize's core product via a chat interface, and your service retrieves documents from your documentation in order to generate a response to the user. As the engineer in charge of evaluating and maintaining this system, you want to evaluate the quality of the responses from your service.\n",
    "\n",
    "Phoenix helps you:\n",
    "- identify gaps in your documentation\n",
    "- detect queries for which the LLM gave bad responses\n",
    "- detect failures to retrieve relevant context\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, you will:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Download an pre-indexed knowledge base of the Arize documentation and run a LlamaIndex application\n",
    "- Visualize user queries and knowledge base documents to identify areas of user interest not answered by your documentation\n",
    "- Find clusters of responses with negative user feedback\n",
    "- Identify failed retrievals using cosine similarity, Euclidean distance, and LLM-assisted ranking metrics\n",

    "1. `llama_index.indices.query.ResponseSynthesizer` generates a response by formatting the query and retrieved context into a single prompt and sending a request to OpenAI chat completions API with the `gpt-3.5-turbo`.\n",
    "2. The response is returned to the user.\n",

      "\n",
      "Image segmentation and object detection are both computer vision tasks, but they\n",

      "pixel in the image, effectively creating a pixel-level mask or segmentation map.\n",
      "This allows for a more detailed understanding of the image's content and\n",
      "structure.  On the other hand, object detection focuses on identifying and\n",
      "locating specific objects within an image or video. Instead of labeling\n",
      "individual pixels, object detection models assign bounding boxes to the objects\n",
      "of interest. These bounding boxes indicate the object's position and size in the\n",

The surrogate model approximates the predictions of the black box model as closely as possible. When the black box model is not available, SHAP values can be generated from the surrogate model. \\n\\nTo enable surrogate explainability in Arize, the user can pass a flag with their request using the Arize Python SDK. When the flag is enabled, a tree-based surrogate model is trained using the dataset's features and predictions. SHAP values are then generated from the surrogate model. The pandas logger in the Arize Python SDK can compute surrogate models for regression and binary classification models.\\n\\nThe feature importance values generated from the surrogate model are sent to the Arize platform using the Pandas logger. This allows users to monitor, troubleshoot, and explain the performance of their models. The surrogate explainability approach provides insights into the importance of different features in the model's predictions.</td>\n",

The surrogate model approximates the predictions of the black box model as closely as possible. When the black box model is not available, SHAP values can be generated from the surrogate model. \\n\\nTo enable surrogate explainability in Arize, the user can pass a flag with their request using the Arize Python SDK. When the flag is enabled, a tree-based surrogate model is trained using the dataset's features and predictions. SHAP values are then generated from the surrogate model. The pandas logger in the Arize Python SDK can compute surrogate models for regression and binary classification models.\\n\\nThe feature importance values generated from the surrogate model are sent to the Arize platform using the Pandas logger. This allows users to monitor, troubleshoot, and explain the performance of their models. The surrogate explainability approach provides insights into the importance of different features in the model's predictions.   \n",

These metrics are used to measure distributional drift between the model's production values and a baseline dataset. Users can configure the baseline to be a pre-production dataset (such as training, test, or validation) or a fixed or moving time period from production. Baselines can be saved in Arize for comparing different versions or environments across different time windows. For more information on baselines, you can visit the provided link.   \n",

SHAP values can then be generated from the surrogate model when the blackbox model is not available. The goal is to approximate the predictions of the black box model as closely as possible and generate feature importance values from the interpretable surrogate model.\\n\\nArize Python SDK (specifically the pandas logger) gives the user the option to pass a flag with their request to send data that would produce SHAP values using the surrogate explainability approach. When the flag is enabled, a tree-based surrogate model is trained using the dataset's features and predictions, and SHAP values are generated from the surrogate model before sending the combined dataset to the Arize platform. The pandas logger can compute surrogate models for regression and binary classification models. For binary classification, the prediction score should have values between 0 and 1.&amp;#x20;\\n\\nIn this Colab we show how to use the `surrogate_explainability` flag without calculating library to generate feature importance values from a surrogate model using only the prediction outputs from a black box model. Both classification and regression examples are provided and feature importance values are sent to Arize using the Pandas logger. The library used to create a surrogate model is only supported for regression and classification models currently.\\n\\n</td>\n",

       "      <td>Arize supports various drift metrics including Population Stability Index, KL Divergence, and Wasserstein Distance. These metrics are used to measure distributional drift between the model's production values and a baseline dataset. Users can configure the baseline to be a pre-production dataset (such as training, test, or validation) or a fixed or moving time period from production. Baselines can be saved in Arize for comparing different versions or environments across different time windows. For more information on baselines, you can visit the provided link.</td>\n",

The surrogate model approximates the predictions of the black box model as closely as possible. When the black box model is not available, SHAP values can be generated from the surrogate model. \\n\\nTo enable surrogate explainability in Arize, the user can pass a flag with their request using the Arize Python SDK. When the flag is enabled, a tree-based surrogate model is trained using the dataset's features and predictions. SHAP values are then generated from the surrogate model. The pandas logger in the Arize Python SDK can compute surrogate models for regression and binary classification models.\\n\\nThe feature importance values generated from the surrogate model are sent to the Arize platform using the Pandas logger. This allows users to monitor, troubleshoot, and explain the performance of their models. The surrogate explainability approach provides insights into the importance of different features in the model's predictions.   \n",

These metrics are used to measure distributional drift between the model's production values and a baseline dataset. Users can configure the baseline to be a pre-production dataset (such as training, test, or validation) or a fixed or moving time period from production.

For an example of logging surrogate model feature importance values values, check out the Arize Surrogate Model Feature Importance tutorial.\\n{% endhint %}\\n\\n! (1).png>)\\n\\nSurrogate explainability is based on the idea of training a surrogate model to mimic a blackbox model, where a surrogate model is an interpretable model trained to approximate the predictions of a black box model as closely as possible. SHAP values can then be generated from the surrogate model when the blackbox model is not available. The goal is to approximate the predictions of the black box model as closely as possible and generate feature importance values from the interpretable surrogate model.\\n\\nArize Python SDK (specifically the pandas logger) gives the user the option to pass a flag with their request to send data that would produce SHAP values using the surrogate explainability approach. When the flag is enabled, a tree-based surrogate model is trained using the dataset's features and predictions, and SHAP values are generated from the surrogate model before sending the combined dataset to the Arize platform. The pandas logger can compute surrogate models for regression and binary classification models. For binary classification, the prediction score should have values between 0 and 1.&#x20;\\n\\nIn this Colab we show how to use the `surrogate_explainability` flag without calculating library to generate feature importance values from a surrogate model using only the prediction outputs from a black box model.

(1).png&gt;)\\n\\nSurrogate explainability is based on the idea of training a surrogate model to mimic a blackbox model, where a surrogate model is an interpretable model trained to approximate the predictions of a black box model as closely as possible. SHAP values can then be generated from the surrogate model when the blackbox model is not available. The goal is to approximate the predictions of the black box model as closely as possible and generate feature importance values from the interpretable surrogate model.\\n\\nArize Python SDK (specifically the pandas logger) gives the user the option to pass a flag with their request to send data that would produce SHAP values using the surrogate explainability approach. When the flag is enabled, a tree-based surrogate model is trained using the dataset's features and predictions, and SHAP values are generated from the surrogate model before sending the combined dataset to the Arize platform. The pandas logger can compute surrogate models for regression and binary classification models. For binary classification, the prediction score should have values between 0 and 1.&amp;#x20;\\n\\nIn this Colab we show how to use the `surrogate_explainability` flag without calculating library to generate feature importance values from a surrogate model using only the prediction outputs from a black box model. Both classification and regression examples are provided and feature importance values are sent to Arize using the Pandas logger.

Fixed or moving time period from production (e.g. last 30 days, last 60 days).&amp;#x20;\\n\\nBaselines are saved in Arize so that users can compare several versions and/or environments against each other across moving or fixed time windows.

For an example of logging surrogate model feature importance values values, check out the Arize Surrogate Model Feature Importance tutorial.\\n{% endhint %}\\n\\n! (1).png>)\\n\\nSurrogate explainability is based on the idea of training a surrogate model to mimic a blackbox model, where a surrogate model is an interpretable model trained to approximate the predictions of a black box model as closely as possible. SHAP values can then be generated from the surrogate model when the blackbox model is not available. The goal is to approximate the predictions of the black box model as closely as possible and generate feature importance values from the interpretable surrogate model.\\n\\nArize Python SDK (specifically the pandas logger) gives the user the option to pass a flag with their request to send data that would produce SHAP values using the surrogate explainability approach. When the flag is enabled, a tree-based surrogate model is trained using the dataset's features and predictions, and SHAP values are generated from the surrogate model before sending the combined dataset to the Arize platform. The pandas logger can compute surrogate models for regression and binary classification models. For binary classification, the prediction score should have values between 0 and 1.&#x20;\\n\\nIn this Colab we show how to use the `surrogate_explainability` flag without calculating library to generate feature importance values from a surrogate model using only the prediction outputs from a black box model. Both classification and regression examples are provided and feature importance values are sent to Arize using the Pandas logger. The library used to create a surrogate model is only supported for regression and classification models currently.\\n\\n   \n",
