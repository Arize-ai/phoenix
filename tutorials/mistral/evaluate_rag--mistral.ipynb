    "\n",
    "LLMs are trained on vast datasets, but these will not include your specific data (things like company knowledge bases and documentation). Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) addresses this by dynamically incorporating your data as context during the generation process. This is done not by altering the training data of the LLMs but by allowing the model to access and utilize your data in real-time to provide more tailored and contextually relevant responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "In RAG, your data is loaded and prepared for queries. This process is called indexing. User queries act on this index, which filters your data down to the most relevant context. This context and your query then are sent to the LLM along with a prompt, and the LLM provides a response.\n",
    "\n",
    "RAG is a critical component for building applications such a chatbots or agents and you will want to know RAG techniques on how to get data into your application.\n",

    "## Stages within RAG\n",
    "\n",
    "There are five key stages within RAG, which will in turn be a part of any larger RAG application.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Loading**: This refers to getting your data from where it lives - whether it's text files, PDFs, another website, a database or an API - into your pipeline.\n",
    "- **Indexing**: This means creating a data structure that allows for querying the data. For LLMs this nearly always means creating vector embeddings, numerical representations of the meaning of your data, as well as numerous other metadata strategies to make it easy to accurately find contextually relevant data.\n",
    "- **Storing**: Once your data is indexed, you will want to store your index, along with any other metadata, to avoid the need to re-index it.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Querying**: For any given indexing strategy there are many ways you can utilize LLMs and data structures to query, including sub-queries, multi-step queries, and hybrid strategies. \n",
    "- **Evaluation**: A critical step in any pipeline is checking how effective it is relative to other strategies, or when you make changes. Evaluation provides objective measures on how accurate, faithful, and fast your responses to queries are.\n"

You can then select the metric of your choice (e.g. hallucinations or QA correctness) to visually inspect the performance of your application and surface problematic clusters. The advantage of this approach is that it provides metrics on granular yet meaningful subsets of your data that help you analyze local, not merely global, performance across a dataset. It's also helpful for gaining intuition around what kind of queries your LLM application is struggling to answer."
