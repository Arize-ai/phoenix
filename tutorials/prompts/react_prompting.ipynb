    "\n",
    "**ReAct (Reasoning + Acting)** is a prompting technique that enables LLMs to think step-by-step before taking action. Unlike traditional prompting, where a model directly provides an answer, ReAct prompts guide the model to reason through a problem first, then decide which tools or actions are necessary to reach the best solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "ReAct is ideal for situations that require **multi-step problem-solving with external tools**. It also improves **transparency** by clearly showing the reasoning behind each tool choice, making it easier to understand and refine the model's actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, you will:\n",
    "- Learn how to craft prompts, tools, and evaluators in Phoenix\n",
    "- Refine your prompts to understand the power of ReAct prompting\n",
    "- Leverage Phoenix and LLM as a Judge techniques to evaluate accuracy at each step, gaining insight into the model's thought process.\n",
    "- Learn how to apply ReAct prompting in real-world scenarios for improved task execution and problem-solving.\n",
