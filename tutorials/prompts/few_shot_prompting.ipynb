    "Few-shot prompting is a powerful technique in prompt engineering that helps LLMs perform tasks more effectively by providing a few examples within the prompt.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike zero-shot prompting, where the model must infer the task with no prior context, or one-shot prompting, where a single example is provided, few-shot prompting leverages multiple examples to guide the model’s responses more accurately.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial you will:\n",
    "- Explore how different prompting strategies impact performance in a sentiment analysis task on a dataset of reviews.\n",
    "- Run an evaluation to measure how the prompt affects the model’s performance\n",
    "- Track your how your prompt and experiment changes overtime in Phoenix\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this tutorial, you’ll have a clear understanding of how structured prompting can significantly enhance the results of any application.\n",
    "\n",
    "⚠️You will need an OpenAI Key for this tutorial.\n",
