    "Balance them across the following categories:\n",
    "1. Highly Positive & Actionable → clear praise AND provides constructive suggestions for improvement.\n",
    "2. Positive but Generic → generally favorable but vague.\n",
    "3. Neutral / Mixed → highlights both pros and cons.\n",
    "4. Negative but Actionable → critical but with constructive feedback.\n",
    "5. Highly Negative & Non-Constructive → strongly negative, unhelpful venting.\n",
    "6. Off-topic → not about clothing at all (e.g., a review mistakenly left about a different product or service). Don't say anything about how the product is not about clothing.\n",

    "- Cover all 6 categories across the 25 reviews.\n",
    "- Use a natural human voice, with realistic details.\n",
    "- Constructive feedback should be specific and actionable.\n",
    "- Make them really hard for someone else to classify. Add ambiguous reviews and reviews that are not clear, such as \"The shirt is fine. Not bad, not great. Might buy again\"\n",
    "- Decide the classified label randomly first and then write the review. Double check all the reviews and make sure you classify them correctly.\n",
