      "- 1 tablespoon coconut oil or vegetable oil\n",
      "- 1 small onion, finely chopped\n",
      "- 2 cloves garlic, minced\n",
      "- 1 thumb-sized piece of ginger, grated\n",
      "- 1 medium carrot, sliced\n",
      "- 1 bell pepper (any color), sliced\n",
      "- 1 zucchini, sliced\n",
      "- 1 cup canned chickpeas, drained and rinsed\n",
      "- 1 can (13.5 oz) coconut milk\n",
      "- 1 teaspoon curry powder\n",
      "- 1/2 teaspoon turmeric\n",
      "- 1/2 teaspoon ground cumin\n",

      "1. **Heat the oil:** In a large skillet or saucepan, heat the coconut oil over medium heat until shimmering.\n",

      "5. **Pour in coconut milk:** Add the coconut milk and chickpeas, stirring to combine. Bring the mixture to a gentle simmer.\n",

      "6. **Simmer:** Reduce the heat to low, cover, and let simmer for 10-15 minutes until the vegetables are tender and the flavors meld together.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Taste and adjust:** Check seasoning and add more salt or spices if needed.\n",
