    "Imagine you're in charge of maintaining a model that takes as input online reviews of your U.S.-based product and classifies the sentiment of each review as positive, negative, or neutral. Your model initially performs well in production, but its performance gradually degrades over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Phoenix helps you surface the reason for this regression by analyzing the embeddings representing the text of each review. Your model was trained on English reviews, but as you'll discover, it's encountering Spanish reviews in production that it can't correctly classify.\n",

    "### Steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Click on \"text_embedding\" in the \"Embeddings\" section.\n",
    "1. In the Euclidean distance graph at the top of the page, click a point on the graph where the Euclidean distance is high.\n",

    "1. Use the panel at the bottom to examine the data points in this cluster.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. What does the Euclidean distance graph measure?\n",
    "1. What do the points in the point cloud represent?\n",
    "1. What do you notice about the cluster you selected?\n",
    "1. What's gone wrong with your model in production?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Answers:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The Euclidean distance graph measures the drift of your production data relative to your training data over time.\n",
    "1. Each point in the point cloud represents a single product review.\n",
    "1. It consists almost entirely of production data, meaning that your model is seeing data in production the likes of which it never saw during training.\n",
    "1. Your model was trained on examples of labeled product reviews in English. In production, your model is encountering product reviews in Spanish whose sentiment it cannot correctly predict.\n",
