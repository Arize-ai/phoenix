      "Question: How do I send traces to Phoenix?\n",
      "Answer: To send traces to Phoenix, you can configure your application to log traces to a remote instance of Phoenix by setting the host and port where the traces will be sent. This can be done by using the environment variables PHOENIX_HOST and PHOENIX_PORT, or by setting the PHOENIX_COLLECTOR_ENDPOINT environment variable. By configuring your instrumentation in this way, your application will be able to send traces to the specified Phoenix instance for collection and visualization.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What happens if I send the same traces twice? \n",
      "Answer: Tracing records the paths taken by requests as they move through multiple steps. Sending the same traces twice would likely result in duplicate records of the paths taken by those requests, potentially leading to redundant information being captured in the tracing system.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: Which frameworks and LLM providers are supported by Arize Phoenix for seamless integration?\n",
      "Answer: Arize Phoenix supports a variety of frameworks and LLM providers for seamless integration, including OpenAI, LangChain, MistralAI, VertexAI, DSPy, AWS Bedrock, Guardrails AI, Haystack, and CrewAI.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: How can users create and manage datasets for prompt testing and fine-tuning in Arize Phoenix?\n",
      "Answer: Users can create and manage datasets for prompt testing and fine-tuning in Arize Phoenix by utilizing the tools provided for data exploration, cleaning, and labeling. These tools enable teams to curate high-quality data that covers a wide range of use cases and edge conditions, facilitating effective prompt testing and fine-tuning processes within the platform.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: How does Arize Phoenix use OpenTelemetry?\n",
      "Answer: Arize Phoenix uses OpenTelemetry for instrumentation and tracing purposes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: How can users visualize embeddings in Arize Phoenix?\n",
      "Answer: Users can visualize embeddings in Arize Phoenix by projecting the embeddings into a lower dimensional space (3 dimensions) using a dimension reduction algorithm called UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection). This allows users to understand how their embeddings have encoded semantic meaning in a visually understandable way. Additionally, users can assign colors to the UMAP point-cloud by dimension, performance, and inference to explore the point-cloud from different perspectives.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What are the main objectives of Arize Phoenix?\n",
      "Answer: The main objectives of Arize Phoenix are to provide an open-source observability library for AI Engineers and Data Scientists to visualize data, evaluate performance, track down issues, and export data to improve their AI models.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What are the steps to set up Arize Phoenix in a local environment?\n",
      "Answer: To set up Arize Phoenix in a local environment, you can follow these steps:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Install Phoenix using pip or conda, or pull the Phoenix server image from Docker Hub.\n",
      "2. Launch Phoenix locally using command line, Docker, or within a notebook.\n",
      "3. Customize your deployment based on your use-case.\n",
      "4. Connect your application to your Phoenix instance by pointing it to the local Phoenix server.\n",
      "5. Optionally, you can configure external storage for data persistence using SQLite or Postgres.\n",
      "6. Ensure Docker is installed and running on your system if using Docker for local setup.\n",
      "\n",

Additionally, you can consider generating synthetic data once you have a few initial examples to quickly expand your dataset. By following these steps, you can create a custom dataset tailored to your specific use case and application requirements.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: How do I export datasets?\n",
      "Answer: You can export datasets by fine-tuning models to achieve higher quality results, train on more examples, save on tokens, and reduce latency requests. Phoenix natively supports exporting OpenAI Fine-Tuning JSONL and OpenAI Evals format as JSONL for evaluating large language models or building systems using LLMs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: How can I contribute to Phoenix?\n",
      "Answer: To contribute to Phoenix, you can start by checking out the development guide, code of conduct, and Contribution License Agreement. Pick a GitHub issue labeled with the tag \"good first issue\" to familiarize yourself with the codebase. Submit your code by forking the Phoenix repository, creating a new branch, and opening a Pull Request (PR) once your work is ready for review. In the PR template, describe the change, including the motivation/context, test coverage, and any other relevant information. A Core reviewer will review your PR, provide feedback, and once approved, your contribution will be merged into Phoenix.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: How do I setup Phoenix in the Terminal?\n",
      "Answer: To set up Phoenix in the Terminal, you can run the following command:\n",
      "```\n",
      "python3 -m phoenix.server.main serve\n",
      "```\n",
      "This command will start the Phoenix server on port 6006. If you are running your instrumented notebook or application on the same machine, traces should automatically be exported to http://127.0.0.1:6006. If the server is running remotely, you will need to modify the environment variable PHOENIX_COLLECTOR_ENDPOINT to point to that machine.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: Does Phoenix support JavaScript?\n",
      "Answer: Phoenix supports JavaScript, specifically TypeScript / JavaScript.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What coding languages does Phoenix support?\n",
      "Answer: Phoenix supports Python and TypeScript/JavaScript for auto-instrumentation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: How do I setup Phoenix as a Container?\n",
      "Answer: To set up Phoenix as a Container, you can start a long-running collector by pulling the Phoenix server image from Docker Hub and then running the image you pulled. Make sure to expose port 6006 so you can view the Phoenix UI at localhost:6006. If you are interested in hosted Phoenix, you can reach out for more information.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: How do I setup Phoenix in a Notebook?\n",
      "Answer: To set up Phoenix in a Notebook, you can run the following code snippet:\n",
      "\n",
      "import phoenix as px\n",
      "\n",
      "session = px.launch_app()\n",
      "\n",
      "This code will initiate a local Phoenix server in the Notebook environment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What is the Data retention policy?\n",
      "Answer: The data retention policy allows users to persist data in the notebook by setting the use_temp_dir flag to false in px.launch_app, which will store the data in SQLite on the disk at the PHOENIX_WORKING_DIR. Alternatively, users can deploy a Phoenix instance and point to it via PHOENIX_COLLECTOR_ENDPOINT.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: Will hosted Phoenix be on the latest version of Phoenix?\n",
      "Answer: Hosted Phoenix will always be on the latest version of Phoenix.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: Is Hosted Phoenix free?\n",
      "Answer: Hosted Phoenix is free for all developers, with plans to introduce a paid tier in the future that will offer increased data retention and additional storage access.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: Can I persist data in the notebook?\n",
      "Answer: Persistence for notebooks (a.k.a. launch_app) is disabled by default. To enable persistence in notebooks, set the use_temp_dir to false. This will allow you to persist data in the notebook by storing it in SQLite on your disk at the PHOENIX_WORKING_DIR. Alternatively, you can deploy a Phoenix instance and point to it via PHOENIX_COLLECTOR_ENDPOINT.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: Can I use gRPC for trace collection?\n",
      "Answer: Phoenix does natively support gRPC for trace collection post 4.0 release.\n",
