    "\n",
    "LlamaIndex provides high-level APIs that enable users to build powerful applications in a few lines of code. However, it can be challenging to understand what is going on under the hood and to pinpoint the cause of issues. Phoenix makes your LLM applications *observable* by visualizing the underlying structure of each call to your query engine and surfacing problematic `spans`` of execution based on latency, token count, or other evaluation metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, you will:\n",
    "- Build a simple query engine using LlamaIndex that uses retrieval-augmented generation to answer questions over the Arize documentation,\n",
    "- Record trace data in [OpenInference tracing](https://github.com/Arize-ai/open-inference-spec/blob/main/trace/spec/traces.md) format using the global `arize_phoenix` handler\n",
    "- Inspect the traces and spans of your application to identify sources of latency and cost,\n",
    "- Export your trace data as a pandas dataframe and run an [LLM Evals](https://docs.arize.com/phoenix/concepts/llm-evals) to measure the precision@k of the query engine's retrieval step.\n",
