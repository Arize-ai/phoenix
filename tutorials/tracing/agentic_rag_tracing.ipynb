    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Agentic RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) combines the power of traditional RAG systems with autonomous agents that can make decisions and take actions. While traditional RAG simply retrieves relevant context and generates responses, agentic RAG adds a layer of agency - the ability to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Break down complex queries into sub-tasks\n",
    "- Choose appropriate tools and actions to complete those tasks\n",
    "- Reason about and synthesize information from multiple sources\n",
    "- Make decisions about what information is relevant\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, rather than just answering questions about data directly, an agentic RAG system might:\n",
    "1. Analyze the user's question to determine required information\n",
    "2. Query multiple data sources or tools as needed\n",
    "3. Combine and reason about the retrieved information\n",
    "4. Generate a comprehensive response\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial demonstrates building an agentic RAG system using LlamaIndex's ReAct agent framework combined with vector and SQL query tools.\n",
