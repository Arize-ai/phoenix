    "- Use Anthropic's [tool calling](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/tool-use) to perform structured data extraction: the task of transforming unstructured input (e.g., user requests in natural language) into structured format (e.g., tabular format),\n",
    "- Instrument your Anthropic client to record trace data in [OpenInference tracing](https://github.com/Arize-ai/open-inference-spec/blob/main/trace/spec/traces.md) format,\n",
    "- Inspect the traces and spans of your application to visualize your trace data,\n",
    "- Export your trace data to run an evaluation on the quality of your structured extractions.\n",

    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "One powerful feature of the Anthropic API is tool use (function calling), wherein a user describes the signature and arguments of one or more functions to the Anthropic API via a JSON Schema and natural language descriptions, and the LLM decides when to call each function and provides argument values depending on the context of the conversation. In addition to its primary purpose of integrating function inputs and outputs into a sequence of chat messages, function calling is also useful for structured data extraction, since you can specify a \"function\" that describes the desired format of your structured output. Structured data extraction is useful for a variety of purposes, including ETL or as input to another machine learning model such as a recommender system.\n",
    "\n",
    "While it's possible to produce structured output without using function calling via careful prompting, function calling is more reliable at producing output that conforms to a particular format. For more details on Anthropic's function calling API, see the [Anthropic documentation](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/home).\n",
