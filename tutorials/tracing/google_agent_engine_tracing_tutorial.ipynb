    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "[Agent Engine](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/agent-engine/overview) is a managed service that helps you to build and deploy agent frameworks. [LangGraph](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/) is a library for building stateful, multi-actor applications with LLMs, used to create agent and multi-agent workflows.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to build, deploy, and test a simple LangGraph application using [Agent Engine](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/agent-engine/overview) in Vertex AI. You'll learn how to combine LangGraph's workflow orchestration with the scalability of Vertex AI, which enables you to build custom generative AI applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the approach used in this notebook defines a [custom application template in Agent Engine](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/agent-engine/customize), which can be extended to LangChain or other orchestration frameworks. If just want to use Agent Engine to build agentic generative AI applications, refer to the documentation for [developing with the LangChain template in Agent Engine](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/agent-engine/develop/overview).\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook covers the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Define Tools**: Create custom Python functions to act as tools your AI application can use.\n",
    "- **Define Router**: Set up routing logic to control conversation flow and tool selection.\n",
    "- **Build a LangGraph Application**: Structure your application using LangGraph, including the Gemini model and custom tools that you define.\n",
    "- **Local Testing**: Test your LangGraph application locally to ensure functionality.\n",
    "- **Deploying to Vertex AI**: Seamlessly deploy your LangGraph application to Agent Engine for scalable execution.\n",
    "- **Remote Testing**: Interact with your deployed application through Vertex AI, testing its functionality in a production-like environment.\n",
    "- **Cleaning Up Resources**: Delete your deployed application on Vertex AI to avoid incurring unnecessary charges.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this notebook, you'll have the skills and knowledge to build and deploy your own custom generative AI applications using LangGraph, Agent Engine, and Vertex AI."
