    "\n",
    "LangChain provides high-level APIs that enable users to build powerful applications in a few lines of code. However, it can be challenging to understand what is going on under the hood and to pinpoint the cause of issues. Phoenix makes your LLM applications *observable* by visualizing the underlying structure of each call to your query engine and surfacing problematic \"spans\" of execution based on latency, token count, or other evaluation metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, you will:\n",
    "- Build a simple question and answer app using LangChain that uses retrieval-augmented generation to answer questions over the Arize documentation,\n",
    "- Record trace data in OpenInference format,\n",
    "- Inspect the traces and spans of your application to identify sources of latency and cost,\n",
    "- Export your trace data as a pandas dataframe and run an LLM-assisted evaluation to measure the precision@k of your retrieval step.\n",
