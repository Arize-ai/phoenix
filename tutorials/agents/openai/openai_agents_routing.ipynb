    "In the following example, we'll build an agent which creates a portfolio of stocks and ETFs based on a user's investment strategy.\n",
    "1.  **Router Agent:** Chooses which worker to use based on the user's investment strategy.\n",
    "2.  **Research Agent:** Searches the web for information about stocks and ETFs that could support the user's investment strategy.\n",
