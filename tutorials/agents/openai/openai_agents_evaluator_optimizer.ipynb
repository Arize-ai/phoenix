    "A starter guide for building an agent which iteratively generates an output based on LLM feedback using the `openai-agents` library.\n",
    "\n",
    "When creating LLM outputs, often times the first generation is unsatisfactory. You can use an agentic loop to iteratively improve the output by asking an LLM to give feedback, and then use the feedback to improve the output.\n",

    "1.  **Report Agent (Generation):** Creates a report on a particular stock ticker.\n",
