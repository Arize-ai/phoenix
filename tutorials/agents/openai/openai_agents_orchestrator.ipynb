    "\n",
    "A starter guide for building an agent loop using the `openai-agents` library.\n",
    "\n",
    "This pattern uses orchestators and workers. The orchestrator chooses which worker to use for a specific sub-task. The worker attempts to complete the sub-task and return a result. The orchestrator then uses the result to choose the next worker to use until a final result is returned.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following example, we'll build an agent which creates a portfolio of stocks and ETFs based on a user's investment strategy.\n",
    "1.  **Orchestrator:** Chooses which worker to use based on the user's investment strategy.\n",
    "2.  **Research Agent:** Searches the web for information about stocks and ETFs that could support the user's investment strategy.\n",
    "3.  **Evaluation Agent:** Evaluates the research report and provides feedback on what data is missing.\n",
    "4.  **Portfolio Agent:** Creates a portfolio of stocks and ETFs based on the research report."
