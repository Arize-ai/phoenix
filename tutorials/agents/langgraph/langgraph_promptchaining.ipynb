        "This notebook demonstrates how to use prompt chaining with LangGraph to build a multi-step email assistant. The assistant guides the writing process through three distinct stages:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Generating an outline based on subject and bullet points\n",
        "\n",
        "- Writing the initial draft using the outline and desired tone\n",
        "\n",
        "- Refining tone if needed to match the specified style\n",
        "\n",
        "This approach enables fine-grained control over the content generation process by decomposing the task into logical steps. Each stage in the graph is handled by a separate node, enabling targeted prompting, intermediate outputs, and conditional logic.\n",
        "\n",
        "In addition, the entire workflow is instrumented with Phoenix, which provides OpenTelemetry-powered tracing and debugging. You can inspect each step’s inputs, outputs, and transitions directly in the Phoenix UI to identify bottlenecks or missteps in generation."
