    "# LangGraph Agents: Orchestrator–Worker Pattern\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we’ll build a multi-agent system using LangGraph's **Orchestrator–Worker pattern**, ideal for dynamically decomposing a task into subtasks, assigning them to specialized LLM agents, and synthesizing their responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "This pattern is particularly well-suited when the structure of subtasks is unknown ahead of time—such as when writing modular code, creating multi-section reports, or conducting research. The **orchestrator** plans and delegates, while the **workers** each complete their assigned section.\n",
    "\n",
    "We’ll also use **Phoenix** to trace and debug the orchestration process. With Phoenix, you can visually inspect which tasks the orchestrator generated, how each worker handled its section, and how the final output was assembled.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this notebook, you’ll learn how to:\n",
    "- Use structured outputs to plan subtasks dynamically.\n",
    "- Assign subtasks to LLM workers via LangGraph's `Send` API.\n",
    "- Collect and synthesize multi-step LLM outputs.\n",
    "- Trace and visualize orchestration using Phoenix.\n"
