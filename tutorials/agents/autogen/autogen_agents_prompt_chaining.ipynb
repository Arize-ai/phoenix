    "# AutoGen Prompt Chaining Agent\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we'll explore **prompt chaining** with [AutoGen agents](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/0.2/docs/Getting-Started) and how to trace using Phoenix.\n",
    "Prompt chaining is a method where a complex task is broken into smaller, linked subtasks, with the output of one step feeding into the next. This workflow is ideal when a task can be cleanly decomposed into fixed subtasks, making each LLM call simpler and more accurate ‚Äî trading off latency for better overall performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "AutoGen makes it easy to build these chains by coordinating multiple agents. Each `AssistantAgent` focuses on a specialized task, while a `UserProxyAgent` manages the conversation flow and passes key outputs between steps. With Phoenix tracing, we can visualize the entire sequence, monitor individual agent calls, and debug the chain more easily.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we'll create a multi-step market analysis workflow, from identifying trends to evaluating company strengths ‚Äî all automated and fully traceable.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this tutorial, you‚Äôll learn how to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Set up specialized AutoGen agents\n",
    "\n",
    "- Chain tasks across agents with carryover context\n",
    "\n",
    "- Improve task accuracy by simplifying each LLM call\n",
    "\n",
    "- Trace and visualize the full execution using Phoenix\n",
    "\n",
