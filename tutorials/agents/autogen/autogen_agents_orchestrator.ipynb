    "In this tutorial, we'll explore orchestrator agent workflows with [AutoGen GroupChats](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/dev//user-guide/core-user-guide/design-patterns/group-chat.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Agent orchestration** enables collaboration among multiple specialized agents, activating only the most relevant one based on the current subtask context. Instead of relying on a fixed sequence, agents dynamically participate depending on the state of the conversation. At termination, results are synthesized together.\n",
    "\n",
    "Agent orchestrator workflows simplifies this routing pattern through a central orchestrator (`GroupChatManager`) that selectively delegates tasks to the appropriate agents. Each agent monitors the conversation but only contributes when their specific expertise is required. With Phoenix tracing, you get full visibility into the orchestration flow to see which agents engaged, when they were activated, and why.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we'll build a smart trip planning assistant where subtasks like destination research, hotel booking, and activity suggestions are dynamically sent to the right specialized agent.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this tutorial, you‚Äôll learn how to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Set up multiple specialized AutoGen agents in a `GroupChat`\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use a `GroupChatManager` to enable dynamic agent routing\n",

    "- Incorporate human feedback in your agent set up\n",
