    "# AutoGen Agents: Evaluator-Optimizer\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we'll explore the **Evaluator-Optimizer agent pattern** using AutoGen [GroupChats](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/dev//user-guide/core-user-guide/design-patterns/group-chat.html) and demonstrate how to trace the process using Phoenix.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Evaluator-Optimizer pattern employs a loop where one agent acts as a generator, creating an initial output (like text or code), while a second agent serves as an evaluator, providing critical feedback against criteria. This feedback guides the generator through successive revisions, enabling iterative refinement and significant quality improvement for complex tasks. This approach trades increased interactions for a more polished & accurate final result.\n",
    "\n",
    "AutoGen's `GroupChat` architecture is good for implementing this pattern becuase it can manage the conversational turns between the generator and evaluator agents. The `GroupChatManager` facilitates the dialogue, allowing the agents to exchange the evolving outputs and feedback.\n",
    "\n",
    "With Phoenix tracing, we can gain full visibility into each refinement cycle, tracking the feedback provided, the revisions made, and the overall progress towards the desired quality standard, which aids in debugging and analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this tutorial, you’ll learn how to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Set up generator and evaluator AutoGen agents with specific roles and criteria.\n",
    "- Implement the Evaluator-Optimizer pattern within an AutoGen GroupChat.\n",
    "- Manage the iterative refinement loop between agents.\n",
    "- Trace and visualize the iterative feedback and revision process using Phoenix.\n",
