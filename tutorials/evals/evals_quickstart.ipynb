    "- Export a dataframe from your Phoenix session that contains traces from an instrumented LLM application,\n",
    "- Evaluate your trace data for:\n",
    "  - Relevance: Are the retrieved documents grounded in the response?\n",
    "  - Q&A correctness: Are your application's responses grounded in the retrieved context?\n",
    "  - Hallucinations: Is your application making up false information?\n",
    "- Ingest the evaluations into Phoenix to see the results annotated on the corresponding spans and traces.\n",
