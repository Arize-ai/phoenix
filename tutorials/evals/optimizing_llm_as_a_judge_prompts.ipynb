    "**What is LLM as a Judge?**\n",
    "\n",
    "An LLM as a Judge refers to using an LLM as a tool for evaluating and scoring responses based on predefined criteria. The LLM functions as a \"judge,\" making decisions and assigning scores based on the input it receives. Some common use cases include evaluations for hallucinations, user frustration, and summarization quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why Do We Want to Refine These Prompts?**\n",
    "\n",
    "While LLMs are powerful tools for evaluation, their performance can be inconsistent. Factors like ambiguity in the prompt, biases in the model, or a lack of clear guidelines can lead to unreliable results. By fine-tuning your LLM prompts, you can improve the model's consistency, fairness, and accuracy, ensuring it delivers more reliable evaluations.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, you will:\n",
    "- Generate an LLM as a Judge evaluation prompt and test it against a datset\n",
    "- Learn about various optimization techniques to improve the template, measuring accuracy at each step using Phoenix evaluations\n",
    "- Understand how to apply these techniques together for better evaluation across your specific use cases\n",

    "    Generate a detailed evaluation template that measures the AI’s ability to recognize user emotions, respond empathetically, and provide emotionally appropriate responses. The template should:\n",
    "    - Emphasize that an AI input is given and that is what will be evaluated\n",
    "    - Include distinct evaluation criteria that assess different aspects of emotional intelligence.\n",
    "    - Define a scoring system on a scale of 1 to 10, ensuring a broad distribution of scores across different responses.\n",
    "    - Provide clear, tiered guidelines for assigning scores, distinguishing weak, average, and strong performance.\n",
    "    - Include a justification section requiring evaluators to explain the assigned score with specific examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ### Format:\n",
    "    Return the evaluation template as plain text, structured with headings, criteria, and a detailed scoring rubric. The template should be easy to follow and apply to real-world datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ### Variables: There should be a spot to pass in an input AI response to evaluate at the beginning. Format it exactly like so: {input}. Explicitly say that this is the input that is being evaluated.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ### Scoring Guidelines:\n",
    "    - The scoring system must be on a **scale of 1 to 10** and encourage a full range of scores. Emphasize that output should only be a number 1-10 for the entire evaluation.\n",
    "    - Differentiate between strong, average, and weak responses using specific, well-defined levels.\n",
    "    - Require evaluators to justify scores\n",
