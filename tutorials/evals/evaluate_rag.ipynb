I wrote what beginning writers were supposed to write then, and probably still are: short stories. My stories were awful. They had hardly any plot, just characters with strong feelings, which I imagined made them deep.\\n\\nThe first programs I tried writing were on the IBM 1401 that our school district used for what was then called \"data processing.\" This was in 9th grade, so I was 13 or 14. The school district\\'s 1401 happened to be in the basement of our junior high school, and my friend Rich Draves and I got permission to use it. It was like a mini Bond villain\\'s lair down there, with all these alien-looking machines ‚Äî CPU, disk drives, printer, card reader ‚Äî sitting up on a raised floor under bright fluorescent lights.\\n\\nThe language we used was an early version of Fortran. You had to type programs on punch cards, then stack them in the card reader and press a button to load the program into memory and run it. The result would ordinarily be to print something on the spectacularly loud printer.\\n\\nI was puzzled by the 1401. I couldn\\'t figure out what to do with it. And in retrospect there\\'s not much I could have done with it. The only form of input to programs was data stored on punched cards, and I didn\\'t have any data stored on punched cards. The only other option was to do things that didn\\'t rely on any input, like calculate approximations of pi, but I didn\\'t know enough math to do anything interesting of that type. So I\\'m not surprised I can\\'t remember any programs I wrote, because they can\\'t have done much. My clearest memory is of the moment I learned it was possible for programs not to terminate, when one of mine didn\\'t. On a machine without time-sharing, this was a social as well as a technical error, as the data center manager\\'s expression made clear.\\n\\nWith microcomputers, everything changed.'"

It was a clever idea of my friend Maria Daniels, who was one of the thursday diners. Three separate hosts would all invite their friends to one party. So for every guest, two thirds of the other guests would be people they didn't know but would probably like. One of the guests was someone I didn't know but would turn out to like a lot: a woman called Jessica Livingston. A couple days later I asked her out.\\n\\nJessica was in charge of marketing at a Boston investment bank. This bank thought it understood startups, but over the next year, as she met friends of mine from the startup world, she was surprised how different reality was. And how colorful their stories were. So she decided to compile a book of interviews with startup founders.\\n\\nWhen the bank had financial problems and she had to fire half her staff, she started looking for a new job. In early 2005 she interviewed for a marketing job at a Boston VC firm. It took them weeks to make up their minds, and during this time I started telling her about all the things that needed to be fixed about venture capital. They should make a larger number of smaller investments instead of a handful of giant ones, they should be funding younger, more technical founders instead of MBAs, they should let the founders remain as CEO, and so on.\\n\\nOne of my tricks for writing essays had always been to give talks. The prospect of having to stand up in front of a group of people and tell them something that won't waste their time is a great spur to the imagination. When the Harvard Computer Society, the undergrad computer club, asked me to give a talk, I decided I would tell them how to start a startup. Maybe they'd be able to avoid the worst of the mistakes we'd made.\""

The only form of input to programs was data stored on punched cards, and the author did not have any data stored on punched cards. Additionally, the author did not know enough math to do anything interesting that didn't rely on input. Therefore, the author couldn't do much with the 1401 computer due to these limitations.\n",

They used an early version of Fortran and had to type programs on punch cards. However, they were puzzled by the 1401 and didn't know what to do with it, as they didn't have any data stored on punched cards.

At the time mentioned in the context, it was not clear that building a web app for making web apps was possible because the concept of web apps was still relatively new and not widely understood.

This low price was a big attraction and a constant challenge for their competitors. However, it was not based on any clever insight or knowledge of what businesses typically paid for such software.

                        "Answer: Lisp evolved from being a formal model of computation to a programming language when John McCarthy's grad student, Steve Russell, suggested that McCarthy's Lisp interpreter could be used to program computers. Russell translated McCarthy's interpreter into IBM 704 machine language, and from that point, Lisp started to be used as a programming language in the ordinary sense. McCarthy's original Lisp interpreter was missing many features that you would want in a programming language, so these had to be added. However, these additions were not defined using McCarthy's original axiomatic approach. McCarthy had tested his interpreter by hand-simulating the execution of programs, but as computers became more powerful, it became feasible to test more complicated interpreters by running them. This allowed for the development of a complete programming language based on McCarthy's Lisp, while still preserving its power and elegance.\n",

                        "Answer: The added features to McCarthy's original Lisp were not defined using his original axiomatic approach because it was not feasible at the time. McCarthy tested his interpreter by hand-simulating the execution of programs, but this method was already reaching the limit of what could be tested that way. Additionally, there was a bug in the interpreter that McCarthy had overlooked. To test a more complicated interpreter, it would have been necessary to run it on computers, which were not powerful enough at the time. Therefore, an alternative approach had to be taken to define and add the additional features to Lisp.\n",

They used an early version of Fortran and had to type programs on punch cards. However, they were puzzled by the 1401 and didn't have much data to work with, so their programs didn't do much.

The author initially tried to put art galleries online, but it was difficult to convince them to use their software. However, they realized that online stores were similar to the sites they were generating for galleries, and they already had the knowledge and skills to build an \"internet storefront.\" This led them to start working on software to build online stores, leveraging their experience in generating websites for galleries. So, while the author's background in art did not directly contribute to building the online store builder, it indirectly influenced their decision to pursue this direction.\n",

However, as YC grew and the founder became more excited about it, it started to take up more of his attention. Over time, YC evolved to become a fund for a couple of years starting in 2009, due to its growth and the need for external funding. Eventually, after acquiring enough money, YC went back to being self-funded. Additionally, YC's focus shifted from being a news aggregator for startup founders to reaching future startup founders and engaging their intellectual curiosity.\n",

McCarthy tested his interpreter by hand-simulating the execution of programs, but this approach was getting close to the limit of interpreters that could be tested that way. Additionally, computers at that time were not powerful enough to run more complex interpreters.
