    "\n",
    "LLMs are trained on vast datasets, but these will not include your specific data (things like company knowledge bases and documentation). Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) addresses this by dynamically incorporating your data as context during the generation process. This is done not by altering the training data of the LLMs but by allowing the model to access and utilize your data in real-time to provide more tailored and contextually relevant responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "In RAG, your data is loaded and prepared for queries. This process is called indexing. User queries act on this index, which filters your data down to the most relevant context. This context and your query then are sent to the LLM along with a prompt, and the LLM provides a response.\n",
    "\n",
    "RAG is a critical component for building applications such a chatbots or agents and you will want to know RAG techniques on how to get data into your application.\n",

    "## Stages within RAG\n",
    "\n",
    "There are five key stages within RAG, which will in turn be a part of any larger RAG application.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Loading**: This refers to getting your data from where it lives - whether it's text files, PDFs, another website, a database or an API - into your pipeline.\n",
    "- **Indexing**: This means creating a data structure that allows for querying the data. For LLMs this nearly always means creating vector embeddings, numerical representations of the meaning of your data, as well as numerous other metadata strategies to make it easy to accurately find contextually relevant data.\n",
    "- **Storing**: Once your data is indexed, you will want to store your index, along with any other metadata, to avoid the need to re-index it.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Querying**: For any given indexing strategy there are many ways you can utilize LLMs and data structures to query, including sub-queries, multi-step queries, and hybrid strategies. \n",
    "- **Evaluation**: A critical step in any pipeline is checking how effective it is relative to other strategies, or when you make changes. Evaluation provides objective measures on how accurate, faithful, and fast your responses to queries are.\n"

       "'What I Worked On\\n\\nFebruary 2021\\n\\nBefore college the two main things I worked on, outside of school, were writing and programming. I didn\\'t write essays. I wrote what beginning writers were supposed to write then, and probably still are: short stories. My stories were awful. They had hardly any plot, just characters with strong feelings, which I imagined made them deep.\\n\\nThe first programs I tried writing were on the IBM 1401 that our school district used for what was then called \"data processing.\" This was in 9th grade, so I was 13 or 14. The school district\\'s 1401 happened to be in the basement of our junior high school, and my friend Rich Draves and I got permission to use it. It was like a mini Bond villain\\'s lair down there, with all these alien-looking machines ‚Äî CPU, disk drives, printer, card reader ‚Äî sitting up on a raised floor under bright fluorescent lights.\\n\\nThe language we used was an early version of Fortran. You had to type programs on punch cards, then stack them in the card reader and press a button to load the program into memory and run it. The result would ordinarily be to print something on the spectacularly loud printer.\\n\\nI was puzzled by the 1401. I couldn\\'t figure out what to do with it. And in retrospect there\\'s not much I could have done with it. The only form of input to programs was data stored on punched cards, and I didn\\'t have any data stored on punched cards. The only other option was to do things that didn\\'t rely on any input, like calculate approximations of pi, but I didn\\'t know enough math to do anything interesting of that type. So I\\'m not surprised I can\\'t remember any programs I wrote, because they can\\'t have done much. My clearest memory is of the moment I learned it was possible for programs not to terminate, when one of mine didn\\'t. On a machine without time-sharing, this was a social as well as a technical error, as the data center manager\\'s expression made clear.\\n\\nWith microcomputers, everything changed.'"

       "\"It felt like I was doing life right. I remember that because I was slightly dismayed at how novel it felt. The good news is that I had more moments like this over the next few years.\\n\\nIn the summer of 2016 we moved to England. We wanted our kids to see what it was like living in another country, and since I was a British citizen by birth, that seemed the obvious choice. We only meant to stay for a year, but we liked it so much that we still live there. So most of Bel was written in England.\\n\\nIn the fall of 2019, Bel was finally finished. Like McCarthy's original Lisp, it's a spec rather than an implementation, although like McCarthy's Lisp it's a spec expressed as code.\\n\\nNow that I could write essays again, I wrote a bunch about topics I'd had stacked up. I kept writing essays through 2020, but I also started to think about other things I could work on. How should I choose what to do? Well, how had I chosen what to work on in the past? I wrote an essay for myself to answer that question, and I was surprised how long and messy the answer turned out to be. If this surprised me, who'd lived it, then I thought perhaps it would be interesting to other people, and encouraging to those with similarly messy lives. So I wrote a more detailed version for others to read, and this is the last sentence of it.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNotes\\n\\n[1] My experience skipped a step in the evolution of computers: time-sharing machines with interactive OSes. I went straight from batch processing to microcomputers, which made microcomputers seem all the more exciting.\\n\\n[2] Italian words for abstract concepts can nearly always be predicted from their English cognates (except for occasional traps like polluzione). It's the everyday words that differ. So if you string together a lot of abstract concepts with a few simple verbs, you can make a little Italian go a long way.\\n\\n[3] I lived at Piazza San Felice 4, so my walk to the Accademia went straight down the spine of old Florence: past the Pitti, across the bridge, past Orsanmichele, between the Duomo and the Baptistery, and then up Via Ricasoli to Piazza San Marco.\""

      "Question: What were the two main things the author worked on before college?\n",
      "Answer: The author worked on writing and programming before college.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What were the limitations of the 1401 computer and why couldn't the author do much with it?\n",
      "Answer: The author mentions that the 1401 computer had limitations in terms of input. The only form of input to programs was data stored on punched cards, and the author did not have any data stored on punched cards. Additionally, the author did not know enough math to do anything interesting that did not rely on input. Therefore, the author couldn't do much with the 1401 computer due to these limitations.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What was the author's first experience with computers and programming?\n",
      "Answer: The author's first experience with computers and programming was in 9th grade when they had access to an IBM 1401 computer in the basement of their junior high school. They used an early version of Fortran and had to type programs on punch cards. However, they were puzzled by the 1401 and didn't know what to do with it, as they didn't have any data stored on punched cards. They couldn't remember any programs they wrote on the 1401, but their clearest memory was when they learned that programs could fail to terminate.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What were the two things that inspired the author to work on AI?\n",
      "Answer: The two things that inspired the author to work on AI were a novel by Heinlein called The Moon is a Harsh Mistress, which featured an intelligent computer called Mike, and a PBS documentary that showed Terry Winograd using SHRDLU.\n",

      "\n",
      "Question: What realization did the author have during their first year of grad school regarding AI?\n",
      "Answer: The author realized that the way AI was being practiced at the time, with programs translating natural language into formal representations, was not effective in truly understanding natural language. They recognized that there was an unbridgeable gap between what these programs could do and actual comprehension of natural language. The author concluded that the approach of using explicit data structures to represent concepts in AI was not going to work.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What motivated the author to write a book about Lisp hacking?\n",
      "Answer: The author was motivated to write a book about Lisp hacking because writing a book about something helps in learning it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What was the author's initial hesitation in getting a computer?\n",
      "Answer: The author's initial hesitation in getting a computer was that he couldn't figure out what to do with it. He didn't have any data stored on punched cards, which was the only form of input to programs at the time. Additionally, he didn't know enough math to do anything interesting with the computer.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What was the author's initial perception of people who made art?\n",
      "Answer: The author initially perceived people who made art as either living long ago or being mysterious geniuses doing strange things in profiles in Life magazine. The idea of actually being able to make art seemed almost miraculous to the author.\n",

      "Answer: The students and faculty in the painting department at the Accademia had arrived at an arrangement whereby the students wouldn't require the faculty to teach anything, and in return the faculty wouldn't require the students to learn anything.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What is the difference between painting still lives and painting people?\n",
      "Answer: Painting still lives and painting people differ in terms of the subject's ability to move. Still lives, as the name suggests, are objects that cannot move, allowing the artist to closely observe and potentially copy them pixel by pixel. On the other hand, people can only sit for a limited amount of time and tend to move, making it necessary for the artist to have a generic understanding of how to paint a person and then modify it to match the specific individual being painted.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What is the purpose of low-level processes in visual perception?\n",
      "Answer: The purpose of low-level processes in visual perception is to identify and categorize objects or elements in the environment without providing detailed information about their specific characteristics or attributes.\n",

      "\n",
      "Question: What did the author learn about technology companies while working at Interleaf?\n",
      "Answer: The author learned several things about technology companies while working at Interleaf. They learned that it is better for technology companies to be run by product people rather than sales people. They also learned that it leads to bugs when code is edited by too many people and that cheap office space can be depressing. Additionally, the author learned that planned meetings are inferior to corridor conversations and that big, bureaucratic customers can be a dangerous source of money. Lastly, they learned that there is not much overlap between conventional office hours and the optimal time for hacking, or conventional offices and the optimal place for it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: According to the author, why is it advantageous to be the 'entry level' option?\n",
      "Answer: Being the 'entry level' option is advantageous because if you're not, someone else will be, and they will surpass you and limit your growth potential. Additionally, being the 'entry level' option allows you to cater to a wider audience and capture a larger market share.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What is the purpose of a signature style in painting?\n",
      "Answer: The purpose of a signature style in painting is to create a visual identity that immediately distinguishes the work as belonging to a specific artist. It serves as a way for artists to express themselves and make their work easily recognizable and unique. Additionally, a signature style can also increase the value and desirability of the artwork, as buyers are often willing to pay a premium for pieces that have a distinctive and recognizable style.\n",

      "Answer: The initial startup idea of the author was to start an investment firm with his friend Jessica and two other partners. They wanted to implement their ideas about venture capital, such as making a larger number of smaller investments, funding younger and more technical founders, and allowing the founders to remain as CEO. However, it is not mentioned in the given context whether this startup idea failed or not.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What was the initial plan for building online stores in the summer of 1995?\n",
      "Answer: The initial plan for building online stores in the summer of 1995 was to write software for normal desktop use, specifically Windows software. However, neither of the individuals involved in the project knew how to write Windows software or wanted to learn. They decided to try writing a prototype store builder on Unix instead.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What is a web app and why was it considered groundbreaking at the time?\n",
      "Answer: A web app is a type of software that can be accessed and used through a web browser, without the need for any additional client software or command line input. It was considered groundbreaking at the time because it was not clear if it was even possible to build a whole store or application through a browser without the need for traditional software installation or server-side command line input. The ability to control and update software directly on the server, without the need for versions or ports, was seen as a significant advancement in software development.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What was the significance of the deal mentioned in the context information for Y Combinator?\n",
      "Answer: The deal mentioned in the context information for Y Combinator was significant because it provided funding for startups in return for a percentage of equity. This deal allowed Y Combinator to scale startup funding by investing in batches of startups, which was more convenient for Y Combinator and provided a supportive community for the founders. Additionally, the deal helped solve the problem of isolation faced by founders and allowed startups to become each other's customers, creating a network effect.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Question: What is the significance of 'doing things that don't scale' in the context of the startup?\n",
      "Answer: The significance of 'doing things that don't scale' in the context of the startup is that it helped the startup gain users and grow. Although it may have seemed humiliating or desperate at the time, the startup built stores for users, which taught them about retail and how it felt to use their software. This hands-on approach to acquiring users was important in the early stages of the startup, even if it was not a scalable long-term strategy. It allowed the startup to understand their users' needs and make necessary improvements to their software.\n",

As a result, many essays that could have been written were never published because there was no way to publish them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What is the significance of Lisp in the author's writing and how does it compare to Latin?\n",
      "Answer: The author finds Lisp significant because it is a language that is defined by writing an interpreter in itself. It was originally intended as a formal model of computation and later became a programming language. The author was attracted to Lisp in college because of its power and elegance.

      "\n",
      "Question: What are some advantages of scale that YC noticed as it grew?\n",
      "Answer: YC noticed several advantages of scale as it grew. One advantage was that the alumni became a tight community, dedicated to helping one another and especially the current batch. Another advantage was that the startups in the program started to become each other's customers. YC also noticed that many startups were getting their initial set of customers almost entirely from among their batchmates.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: Why did the author change the name of the platform to Hacker News?\n",
      "Answer: The author changed the name of the platform to Hacker News because they wanted to reach future startup founders, not just current startup founders. They believed that the name \"Hacker News\" would be more appealing and engaging to those who had an intellectual curiosity, rather than focusing solely on startups.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What made YC different from other kinds of work the author had done?\n",
      "Answer: The problems came to the author instead of the author deciding what to work on. Every 6 months, there was a new batch of startups with their own problems, which became the author's problems. This made the work engaging and allowed the author to learn a lot about startups in a short amount of time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: Why did Rtm offer unsolicited advice to the author?\n",

      "\n",
      "Question: Why did the founders of YC decide to recruit Sam Altman as the new president?\n",
      "Answer: The founders of YC decided to recruit Sam Altman as the new president because they wanted YC to last for a long time and believed that it couldn't be controlled by the founders. They wanted to make a complete changing of the guard and allow Sam Altman to reorganize YC. Initially, Sam Altman said no to the offer as he wanted to start a startup to make nuclear reactors, but after persistent persuasion, he finally agreed in October 2013.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What did the author decide to do after stopping work on YC?\n",
      "Answer: After stopping work on YC, the author decided to start painting. They wanted to see how good they could get at painting if they really focused on it. They spent most of the rest of 2014 painting, and although they got better, they felt they were not good enough. However, in November, they ran out of steam and stopped working on the painting. They then started writing essays again and eventually started working on Lisp.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What is the distinctive feature of Lisp that sets it apart from other programming languages?\n",
      "Answer: Lisp is distinctive because its core is a language defined by writing an interpreter in itself. It was originally intended as a formal model of computation, rather than a traditional programming language. This unique feature gives Lisp a power and elegance that other languages cannot match.\n",

      "Question: What was the reason why McCarthy's original axiomatic approach couldn't be used to define the added features?\n",
      "Answer: The reason why McCarthy's original axiomatic approach couldn't be used to define the added features is because it wouldn't have been feasible at the time. McCarthy tested his interpreter by hand-simulating the execution of programs, but as the interpreter became more complex, it was getting close to the limit of what could be tested that way. Additionally, computers at that time were not powerful enough to run a more complicated interpreter. Therefore, a different approach had to be taken to define the added features.\n",

      "Answer: The author's experience with computers was initially limited to mainframe computers, where the only form of input was data stored on punched cards. They didn't have access to much data or the knowledge to do anything interesting with the computer. However, when microcomputers became available, the author's perception changed. They were impressed and envious of their friend who built a microcomputer kit and could type programs directly into the computer. This experience led the author to convince their father to buy a TRS-80, which marked the start of their programming journey. The author wrote simple games, a program to predict rocket heights, and even a word processor. The availability of microcomputers, with their immediate response to keystrokes, made a significant impact on the author's perception and enthusiasm for programming.\n",

      "Question: How did microcomputers change the author's experience with programming? Provide specific examples.\n",
      "Answer: Microcomputers changed the author's experience with programming by allowing him to have a computer right in front of him, on a desk, that could respond to his keystrokes as it was running. This was a significant departure from the previous method of programming, which involved using punched cards and waiting for the computer to process them. With microcomputers, the author was able to directly type programs into the computer, which made programming more interactive and immediate. \n",
      "\n",
      "Specific examples of how microcomputers changed the author's experience with programming include:\n",
      "- The author's friend built a microcomputer from a kit and the author was impressed and envious watching him type programs right into the computer.\n",
      "- The author convinced his father to buy a TRS-80 microcomputer, which allowed him to start programming in earnest. He wrote simple games, a program to predict rocket flight, and even a word processor that his father used to write a book. The limited memory of the microcomputer meant that his father had to write two pages at a time and then print them out, but it was still a significant improvement over using a typewriter. \n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, microcomputers provided the author with a more accessible and hands-on experience with programming, enabling him to directly interact with the computer and write programs in a more immediate and interactive manner.\n",

      "\n",
      "Question: Why is it beneficial for the brain to not notice every detail in everyday life?\n",
      "Answer: Noticing every detail in everyday life would be distracting. The brain handles most visual perception through low-level processes that only provide basic information, such as identifying objects without specifying details like the shape and position of every leaf on a bush or the lightest and darkest points on a water droplet. This is a feature of the brain, not a bug, as it allows us to focus on what is important and not get overwhelmed by the sheer amount of visual information.\n",

      "Question: How did Lisp evolve from being a formal model of computation to a programming language?\n",
      "Answer: Lisp evolved from being a formal model of computation to a programming language when John McCarthy's grad student, Steve Russell, suggested that McCarthy's Lisp interpreter could be used to program computers. Russell translated McCarthy's interpreter into IBM 704 machine language, and from that point, Lisp started to be used as a programming language in the ordinary sense. McCarthy's original Lisp interpreter was then expanded to include additional features that were necessary for a programming language.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: Why was it difficult to test a more complicated interpreter using McCarthy's original approach?\n",
      "Answer: Testing a more complicated interpreter using McCarthy's original approach was difficult because computers at that time were not powerful enough. McCarthy had to hand-simulate the execution of programs to test his interpreter, but as the complexity of the interpreter increased, it became impractical to test it in this way. To test a more complicated interpreter, it would have been necessary to run it on a computer, but the computers of that era did not have enough power to handle such complex programs.\n",

      "Question: What is the relationship between Italian and English words in terms of abstract concepts and everyday words?\n",
      "Answer: Italian words for abstract concepts can nearly always be predicted from their English cognates, except for occasional traps. However, it's the everyday words that differ between Italian and English. So, if you string together a lot of abstract concepts with a few simple verbs, you can make a little Italian go a long way.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What is the difference between rent-controlled and rent-stabilized apartments, and why is it significant in the context of the passage?\n",
      "Answer: Rent-controlled and rent-stabilized apartments are different in terms of the regulations that govern their rent prices. Rent-controlled apartments have strict regulations on rent increases and are typically occupied by long-term tenants. On the other hand, rent-stabilized apartments have more flexible regulations, allowing for gradual rent increases over time. \n",
      "\n",
      "In the context of the passage, the significance lies in the fact that the apartment being referred to is described as \"really cheap, less than half market price.\" This suggests that the apartment is likely rent-stabilized rather than rent-controlled. The distinction between the two types of apartments is important because it helps to explain why the rent for this particular apartment is significantly lower than the market price.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What is the significance of treating the online version as the primary version when publishing online?\n",
      "Answer: Treating the online version as the primary version when publishing online is significant because it allows for a wider audience to access and read the content. In the print era, there was a limited channel for publishing essays, and only a select few specialists were allowed to publish their work. By publishing online, anyone can publish their essays and make them accessible to a global audience. This opens up opportunities for more diverse voices and perspectives to be heard, as well as allows for the dissemination of ideas that may not have been able to be published in the traditional print format.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: Why did the founder choose orange as the color for Y Combinator?\n",
      "Answer: The founder chose orange as the color for Y Combinator partly because it is the warmest color and partly because no venture capitalist (VC) used it at the time. The VCs typically used more traditional colors like maroon, navy blue, and forest green in order to appeal to limited partners (LPs), not founders.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What problem arises when running a forum and writing essays simultaneously?\n",
      "Answer: Running a forum and writing essays simultaneously can be challenging because it requires dividing one's time and attention between two different tasks. This can lead to a lack of focus and potentially result in a decrease in the quality or quantity of both forum management and essay writing. Additionally, managing a forum involves engaging with the community, moderating discussions, and addressing any issues that may arise, which can be time-consuming and distract from the writing process. Conversely, writing essays requires concentration, research, and reflection, which may be difficult to achieve while also managing a forum. Therefore, balancing these two activities can be a problem for individuals trying to do both simultaneously.\n",

      "Question: What realization did the author have during their first year of grad school regarding AI?\n",
      "Answer: The author realized that the way AI was being practiced at the time, with programs translating natural language into formal representations, was not effective in actually understanding natural language. They recognized that there was an unbridgeable gap between what these programs could do and true understanding of natural language. The author concluded that the approach of using explicit data structures to represent concepts in AI was not going to work.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What is the main difference between theory and systems in computer science according to the author?\n",
      "Answer: The author states that the main difference between theory and systems in computer science is that theory people prove things, while systems people build things.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: Why did the author feel dissatisfied with systems work in computer science?\n",
      "Answer: The author felt dissatisfied with systems work in computer science because any program they wrote would become obsolete in a couple of decades at best.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: Why did the author find the idea of making art almost miraculous?\n",
      "Answer: The author found the idea of making art almost miraculous because they had always viewed artists as a different species or mysterious geniuses. They believed that art didn't just appear spontaneously and that the people who made it either lived long ago or were doing strange things in profiles in Life magazine. The concept of actually being able to make art themselves seemed almost unbelievable to the author.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What topic did the author choose for their dissertation and why?\n",
      "Answer: The author chose applications of continuations as the topic for their dissertation. The reason for this choice is not explicitly stated in the given context.\n",

      "\n",
      "Question: Describe the arrangement between the students and faculty in the painting department at the Accademia.\n",
      "Answer: The arrangement between the students and faculty in the painting department at the Accademia is such that the students do not require the faculty to teach anything, and in return, the faculty does not require the students to learn anything. Despite this arrangement, both the students and faculty outwardly adhere to the conventions of a 19th-century atelier.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What is the difference between painting still lives and painting people?\n",
      "Answer: Painting still lives and painting people differ in terms of the subject's ability to move. Still lives, as the name suggests, are objects that cannot move, allowing the artist to closely observe and potentially copy them pixel by pixel. On the other hand, people can only sit for a limited amount of time and tend to move, making it necessary for the artist to have a generic understanding of how to paint a person and then modify it to match the specific individual being painted.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What does the author mean by 'emphasizing the visual cues' in a still life painting?\n",
      "Answer: By 'emphasizing the visual cues' in a still life painting, the author means highlighting the subtle details and characteristics that convey information about the objects being painted. This could include features like the sudden change in color at the edge of an object, which indicates its shape and position. The author suggests that by subtly emphasizing these visual cues, the artist can create paintings that are more realistic than photographs, not just in a metaphorical sense, but in terms of conveying detailed information.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What was the role of the scripting language in Interleaf's software?\n",
      "Answer: The scripting language in Interleaf's software served as a way to extend the functionality of the software and allowed users to write custom scripts.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: How did the author benefit financially from working at Interleaf?\n",
      "Answer: The author benefited financially from working at Interleaf by getting paid a significant amount of money, especially compared to their previous budget as an art student. They were paid more than four times their previous daily budget every hour, even when they were just sitting in a meeting. This allowed them to save enough money to go back to RISD and also pay off their college loans.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What new technology did the author learn about during a visit to Interleaf later on?\n",
      "Answer: HTML\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: In the context of art school, what is a 'signature style' and why do buyers pay a lot for such work?\n",
      "Answer: A 'signature style' in the context of art school refers to a visual style that immediately identifies the work as belonging to a specific artist and no one else. It is similar to a \"schtick\" in show business. Buyers often pay a lot for artwork with a signature style because it is unique and distinguishes the work from others. It adds value and prestige to the artwork, which is why buyers are willing to pay a higher price for such work.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: Why did the author drop out of RISD in 1993?\n",
      "Answer: The context information does not provide any information about the author dropping out of RISD in 1993.\n",

      "Question: Who were Idelle and Julian Weber and what was their significance to the author?\n",
      "Answer: Idelle and Julian Weber were individuals who were significant to the author.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What was the author's startup idea and why was it not successful?\n",
      "Answer: The author's startup idea was to start their own investment firm and implement the ideas they had been discussing. However, the startup idea was not successful because they had no prior knowledge or experience in angel investing, and there were no mentors or experts available in Boston in 2005 to learn from. Despite their lack of knowledge, they made what seemed like obvious choices and some of their decisions turned out to be novel.\n",
