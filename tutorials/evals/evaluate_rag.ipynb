    "\n",
    "LLMs are trained on vast datasets, but these will not include your specific data (things like company knowledge bases and documentation). Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) addresses this by dynamically incorporating your data as context during the generation process. This is done not by altering the training data of the LLMs but by allowing the model to access and utilize your data in real-time to provide more tailored and contextually relevant responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "In RAG, your data is loaded and prepared for queries. This process is called indexing. User queries act on this index, which filters your data down to the most relevant context. This context and your query then are sent to the LLM along with a prompt, and the LLM provides a response.\n",
    "\n",
    "RAG is a critical component for building applications such a chatbots or agents and you will want to know RAG techniques on how to get data into your application.\n",

    "\n",
    "There are five key stages within RAG, which will in turn be a part of any larger RAG application.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Loading**: This refers to getting your data from where it lives - whether it's text files, PDFs, another website, a database or an API - into your pipeline.\n",
    "- **Indexing**: This means creating a data structure that allows for querying the data. For LLMs this nearly always means creating vector embeddings, numerical representations of the meaning of your data, as well as numerous other metadata strategies to make it easy to accurately find contextually relevant data.\n",
    "- **Storing**: Once your data is indexed, you will want to store your index, along with any other metadata, to avoid the need to re-index it.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Querying**: For any given indexing strategy there are many ways you can utilize LLMs and data structures to query, including sub-queries, multi-step queries, and hybrid strategies. \n",
    "- **Evaluation**: A critical step in any pipeline is checking how effective it is relative to other strategies, or when you make changes. Evaluation provides objective measures on how accurate, faithful, and fast your responses to queries are.\n"

       "'What I Worked On\\n\\nFebruary 2021\\n\\nBefore college the two main things I worked on, outside of school, were writing and programming. I didn\\'t write essays. I wrote what beginning writers were supposed to write then, and probably still are: short stories. My stories were awful. They had hardly any plot, just characters with strong feelings, which I imagined made them deep.\\n\\nThe first programs I tried writing were on the IBM 1401 that our school district used for what was then called \"data processing.\" This was in 9th grade, so I was 13 or 14. The school district\\'s 1401 happened to be in the basement of our junior high school, and my friend Rich Draves and I got permission to use it. It was like a mini Bond villain\\'s lair down there, with all these alien-looking machines ‚Äî CPU, disk drives, printer, card reader ‚Äî sitting up on a raised floor under bright fluorescent lights.\\n\\nThe language we used was an early version of Fortran. You had to type programs on punch cards, then stack them in the card reader and press a button to load the program into memory and run it. The result would ordinarily be to print something on the spectacularly loud printer.\\n\\nI was puzzled by the 1401. I couldn\\'t figure out what to do with it. And in retrospect there\\'s not much I could have done with it. The only form of input to programs was data stored on punched cards, and I didn\\'t have any data stored on punched cards. The only other option was to do things that didn\\'t rely on any input, like calculate approximations of pi, but I didn\\'t know enough math to do anything interesting of that type. So I\\'m not surprised I can\\'t remember any programs I wrote, because they can\\'t have done much. My clearest memory is of the moment I learned it was possible for programs not to terminate, when one of mine didn\\'t. On a machine without time-sharing, this was a social as well as a technical error, as the data center manager\\'s expression made clear.\\n\\nWith microcomputers, everything changed.'"

       "\"I remember taking the boys to the coast on a sunny day in 2015 and figuring out how to deal with some problem involving continuations while I watched them play in the tide pools. It felt like I was doing life right. I remember that because I was slightly dismayed at how novel it felt. The good news is that I had more moments like this over the next few years.\\n\\nIn the summer of 2016 we moved to England. We wanted our kids to see what it was like living in another country, and since I was a British citizen by birth, that seemed the obvious choice. We only meant to stay for a year, but we liked it so much that we still live there. So most of Bel was written in England.\\n\\nIn the fall of 2019, Bel was finally finished. Like McCarthy's original Lisp, it's a spec rather than an implementation, although like McCarthy's Lisp it's a spec expressed as code.\\n\\nNow that I could write essays again, I wrote a bunch about topics I'd had stacked up. I kept writing essays through 2020, but I also started to think about other things I could work on. How should I choose what to do? Well, how had I chosen what to work on in the past? I wrote an essay for myself to answer that question, and I was surprised how long and messy the answer turned out to be. If this surprised me, who'd lived it, then I thought perhaps it would be interesting to other people, and encouraging to those with similarly messy lives. So I wrote a more detailed version for others to read, and this is the last sentence of it.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNotes\\n\\n[1] My experience skipped a step in the evolution of computers: time-sharing machines with interactive OSes. I went straight from batch processing to microcomputers, which made microcomputers seem all the more exciting.\\n\\n[2] Italian words for abstract concepts can nearly always be predicted from their English cognates (except for occasional traps like polluzione). It's the everyday words that differ. So if you string together a lot of abstract concepts with a few simple verbs, you can make a little Italian go a long way.\""

      "Question: What were the two main things the author worked on before college?\n",
      "Answer: The author worked on writing and programming before college.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: Explain the author's realization about AI during their first year of grad school. What was the main issue they identified with the existing approach to AI?\n",
      "Answer: The author realized during their first year of grad school that the existing approach to AI, which involved programs translating natural language into formal representations, was fundamentally flawed. They identified that these programs only demonstrated a subset of natural language that was a formal language, but not a comprehensive understanding of natural language. The main issue the author identified was the unbridgeable gap between what these programs could accomplish and true comprehension of natural language.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What were the main sources of stress for the individual in their work at YC?\n",
      "Answer: The main sources of stress for the individual in their work at YC were Hacker News (HN) and writing all of YC's internal software in Arc.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: How did the narrator's decision to buy a house in the Santa Cruz Mountains impact their ability to paint?\n",
      "Answer: The narrator's decision to buy a house in the Santa Cruz Mountains impacted their ability to paint because it isolated them from people and resources, making it difficult to find the energy and ambition to pursue painting.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: How does the author describe the process of painting still lives and the level of detail required compared to everyday visual perception?\n",
      "Answer: The author describes painting still lives as a process that requires close observation and attention to detail. Unlike everyday visual perception, where low-level processes handle most of the information without providing specific details, painting still lives demands a closer look to capture intricate visual cues and details that are often overlooked in everyday life. This heightened level of scrutiny allows the artist to notice new things even after days of observation, highlighting the depth of detail required in painting compared to casual visual perception.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: Explain the significance of skipping a step in the evolution of computers, as mentioned in note [1], and how it impacted the author's perception of microcomputers.\n",
      "Answer: Skipping the step of using punched cards as input and directly interacting with the computer through keystrokes on microcomputers revolutionized the author's experience with programming. This direct interaction allowed for immediate feedback and real-time programming, unlike the traditional method of submitting punched cards and waiting for results. This change in interaction significantly impacted the author's perception of microcomputers, making programming more accessible, interactive, and engaging compared to the previous cumbersome and less interactive process with punched cards.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: Why did the author decide to name the new company 'Aspra' initially?\n",
      "Answer: The author decided to name the new company 'Aspra' initially because the term \"application service provider\" or ASP was commonly used at that time to describe the kind of company Viaweb was.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: Why did the founders of YC decide to recruit Sam Altman to take over as president?\n",
      "Answer: The founders of YC decided to recruit Sam Altman to take over as president because they wanted YC to last for a long time and realized that for that to happen, it couldn't be controlled by the original founders. They believed that by letting Sam reorganize YC and take over as president, it would ensure the longevity and success of the organization.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: Explain the difference between painting still lives and painting people, in terms of the subjects' ability to move and the artist's approach to capturing the subject.\n",
      "Answer: Painting still lives involves subjects that cannot move, allowing the artist to potentially replicate the scene pixel by pixel for accuracy. On the other hand, painting people involves subjects that can move, requiring the artist to have a generic understanding of how to paint a person and then adjust it to match the specific individual being painted.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What was the realization that prompted the narrator to finally stop procrastinating about angel investing?\n",
      "Answer: The realization that prompted the narrator to finally stop procrastinating about angel investing was the convergence of various factors, including the delay from VCs in making decisions, the desire to work with former colleagues on new projects, and the opportunity to start their own investment firm to implement their ideas.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: Describe the author's experience with programming on the IBM 1401 in 9th grade.\n",
      "Answer: The author's experience with programming on the IBM 1401 in 9th grade involved using an early version of Fortran. Programs had to be typed on punch cards, stacked in the card reader, and loaded into memory to run. The author found the machine puzzling as the only input was data stored on punched cards, which they didn't have. Without much data or advanced math knowledge, the author couldn't do anything significant with the programs. One memorable moment was when the author realized programs could fail to terminate, leading to a social and technical error with the data center manager.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: Why did the author decide to focus on Lisp and write a book about Lisp hacking? How did their perception of Lisp change throughout the process?\n",
      "Answer: The author decided to focus on Lisp and write a book about Lisp hacking to learn more about it. Initially, the author had little knowledge about Lisp hacking but believed that writing a book about it would help them learn. As they delved into Lisp, they discovered its distinctive feature of being a language defined by writing an interpreter in itself. This unique aspect of Lisp, as a formal model of computation, intrigued the author and attracted them in college, even though they didn't fully understand it at the time. The author's perception of Lisp evolved as they realized its power and elegance, stemming from its origins as a model of computation. They came to appreciate Lisp's ability to evolve into a complete programming language while maintaining a quality that other languages couldn't match.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: How did the individual's role at YC differ from other types of work they had done in the past?\n",
      "Answer: The individual's role at YC differed from other types of work they had done in the past because, instead of deciding for themselves what to work on, the problems came to them. Every 6 months, there was a new batch of startups, and their problems became the individual's problems. This made the work very engaging as the problems were varied, and the good founders were very effective.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What changes did the narrator experience upon returning to New York after spending time in California?\n",
      "Answer: Upon returning to New York after spending time in California, the narrator resumed their old life but with the added wealth. They mentioned that they could now easily hail taxis, dine in charming restaurants, and choose a neighborhood to live in when looking for an apartment to buy. Additionally, the narrator's painting endeavors started to improve, and they experimented with a new technique for still life paintings.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What was the author's experience at the Accademia and why did they ultimately decide to return to the US?\n",
      "Answer: The author's experience at the Accademia was characterized by a lack of substantial teaching and learning, as the faculty and students had an arrangement where little was required from either side. Despite the friendly atmosphere, the educational standards seemed lacking. The author ultimately decided to return to the US because they were accepted into RISD, and did not hear back from the Accademia after applying.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: Describe the author's daily walk from Piazza San Felice 4 to the Accademia in Florence, as detailed in note [3], and discuss the importance of experiencing the city at street level.\n",
      "Answer: The author's daily walk from Piazza San Felice 4 to the Accademia in Florence involved passing significant landmarks of old Florence. The walk went straight down the spine of old Florence, past the Pitti, across the bridge, past Orsanmichele, between the Duomo and the Baptistery, and then up Via Ricasoli to Piazza San Marco. This route allowed the author to experience Florence at street level in various conditions, from empty dark winter evenings to bustling summer days filled with tourists.\n",
      "\n",
      "Experiencing the city at street level is important as it provides a more intimate and authentic understanding of the place. Walking through the streets allows one to observe the daily life of the city, interact with locals, and appreciate the architecture and atmosphere in a way that is not possible from a distance or through quick visits. It offers a deeper connection to the city's history, culture, and people, enriching the overall experience and creating lasting memories.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What realization led the author to switch from building a company to working on an open source project?\n",
      "Answer: Realizing that running a big company was not something the author wanted to do anymore, especially since the initial motivation for starting the company was no longer relevant, led the author to switch from building a company to working on an open source project.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What significant event caused the original founder to step back from running YC and focus on painting?\n",
      "Answer: The death of the original founder's mother on January 15, 2014, was the significant event that caused him to step back from running YC and focus on painting.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: How does the author describe the process of painting still lives and the level of detail required compared to everyday visual perception?\n",
      "Answer: The author describes painting still lives as a process where one can closely observe and capture details that are often overlooked in everyday visual perception. While everyday visual perception is handled by low-level processes that provide basic identification of objects, painting still lives requires a deeper level of scrutiny to notice intricate details such as the lightest and darkest points, shapes, and positions. This heightened attention to detail is necessary in painting still lives to create realistic representations that go beyond mere photographic accuracy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: How did the narrator's conversation with Robert and Trevor lead to the decision to start their own investment firm?\n",
      "Answer: The narrator's conversation with Robert and Trevor led to the decision to start their own investment firm because they had been discussing potential projects to collaborate on and missed working together. This, combined with the narrator's frustration with the delay from the VCs they had interviewed with, culminated in the decision to start their own firm where the narrator would provide the funding, Jessica would join as an employee, and Robert and Trevor would become partners.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: How did the author's experience with programming change with the introduction of microcomputers?\n",
      "Answer: The author's experience with programming changed significantly with the introduction of microcomputers. With microcomputers, the author could have a computer right in front of them on a desk, allowing for immediate response to keystrokes while the program was running. This was a stark contrast to the previous method of using punched cards for input and waiting for the program to run through them. The availability of microcomputers enabled the author to write programs directly into the computer, leading to a more interactive and engaging programming experience.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: Discuss the author's perspective on the relationship between theory and systems in Computer Science. Why did they prefer building things over proving things? What challenge did they face with systems work?\n",
      "Answer: The author values both theory and systems in Computer Science but expresses a preference for building things over proving things. They find building things more exciting despite acknowledging the admirable nature of theory. The challenge the author faced with systems work was the transient nature of the programs they built - knowing that any software created would eventually become obsolete, leading to a sense of dissatisfaction with the work's lasting impact.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: Why did the individual continue to work hard at YC, even at parts of the job they didn't like?\n",
      "Answer: The individual continued to work hard at YC, even at parts of the job they didn't like, because they were motivated by the belief that as the boss, their work ethic would set the standard for everyone else's effort. They wanted YC to be successful and felt that working hard themselves would encourage others to do the same.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What idea did the narrator have in the spring of 2000, and why did they believe it was a viable concept?\n",
      "Answer: The narrator had the idea to build a web app for making web apps in the spring of 2000. They believed it was a viable concept because it was clear from their experience with Viaweb that web apps were the future, and they saw the potential in allowing people to edit code on their server through the browser and host resulting applications for them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What unique feature did Interleaf add to their software, inspired by Emacs, and how did it impact the software industry according to the author?\n",
      "Answer: Interleaf added a scripting language to their software, inspired by Emacs, and made the scripting language a dialect of Lisp. This unique feature allowed them to hire a Lisp hacker to write programs in it. The author mentions that this addition had an impact on the software industry by highlighting that low-end software tends to overshadow high-end software.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: Discuss the impact of Moore's Law on companies like Interleaf, as explained in note [5], and analyze how exponential growth in processor power affected the technology industry in the 1990s.\n",
      "Answer: Moore's Law had a significant impact on companies like Interleaf, as detailed in note [5]. The exponential growth in processor power driven by Moore's Law during the 1990s led to the rapid advancement of commodity processors, particularly those from Intel. This growth in processing power had a profound effect on the technology industry, causing high-end and specialized hardware and software companies like Interleaf to struggle and ultimately be overshadowed. The relentless pace of improvement in processor capabilities made it challenging for companies to keep up with the rapidly evolving technology landscape, leading to the demise of many companies that were unable to adapt quickly enough to the changing market dynamics.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What was the new dialect of Lisp that the author and Dan started working on, and where did they work on it?\n",
      "Answer: The new dialect of Lisp that the author and Dan started working on was called Arc, and they worked on it in a house in Cambridge.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: How did the death of the founder's mother impact his involvement in YC and his decision to pursue painting?\n",
      "Answer: The death of the founder's mother led him to gradually step back from his involvement in Y Combinator (YC) and focus more on his personal life. This event prompted him to delegate more responsibilities to Sam Altman to prepare him for taking over YC. Additionally, the founder's mother's passing made him reassess his priorities and consider doing something completely different, like painting, as a way to shift his focus and explore a new endeavor.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What is emphasized in painting still lives to make them more realistic than photographs, according to the author? Provide an example to support your answer.\n",
      "Answer: Emphasizing visual cues such as the reason for sudden color changes at certain points, like the edge of an object, is highlighted by the author to make still life paintings more realistic than photographs. This emphasis on subtle details helps convey a sense of depth and texture that goes beyond mere photographic accuracy. For instance, by subtly emphasizing the visual cue of a sudden color change at the edge of an object, a painter can create a more realistic representation that captures the essence of the subject in a way that surpasses the limitations of a photograph.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What was the unique approach taken by the narrator and his partners in setting up their angel firm, Y Combinator, in contrast to traditional VC firms and individual angels?\n",
      "Answer: The unique approach taken by the narrator and his partners in setting up their angel firm, Y Combinator, was to combine the aspects of traditional VC firms and individual angels. They aimed to make smaller seed investments like individual angels but also provide comprehensive support to startups like traditional VC firms. This approach was different from the existing models at the time, where VC firms made large investments without much initial support, and individual angels made smaller investments without the same level of hands-on assistance for founders.\n",
