I wrote what beginning writers were supposed to write then, and probably still are: short stories. My stories were awful. They had hardly any plot, just characters with strong feelings, which I imagined made them deep.\\n\\nThe first programs I tried writing were on the IBM 1401 that our school district used for what was then called \"data processing.\" This was in 9th grade, so I was 13 or 14. The school district\\'s 1401 happened to be in the basement of our junior high school, and my friend Rich Draves and I got permission to use it. It was like a mini Bond villain\\'s lair down there, with all these alien-looking machines ‚Äî CPU, disk drives, printer, card reader ‚Äî sitting up on a raised floor under bright fluorescent lights.\\n\\nThe language we used was an early version of Fortran. You had to type programs on punch cards, then stack them in the card reader and press a button to load the program into memory and run it. The result would ordinarily be to print something on the spectacularly loud printer.\\n\\nI was puzzled by the 1401. I couldn\\'t figure out what to do with it. And in retrospect there\\'s not much I could have done with it. The only form of input to programs was data stored on punched cards, and I didn\\'t have any data stored on punched cards. The only other option was to do things that didn\\'t rely on any input, like calculate approximations of pi, but I didn\\'t know enough math to do anything interesting of that type. So I\\'m not surprised I can\\'t remember any programs I wrote, because they can\\'t have done much. My clearest memory is of the moment I learned it was possible for programs not to terminate, when one of mine didn\\'t. On a machine without time-sharing, this was a social as well as a technical error, as the data center manager\\'s expression made clear.\\n\\nWith microcomputers, everything changed.'"

It felt like I was doing life right. I remember that because I was slightly dismayed at how novel it felt. The good news is that I had more moments like this over the next few years.\\n\\nIn the summer of 2016 we moved to England. We wanted our kids to see what it was like living in another country, and since I was a British citizen by birth, that seemed the obvious choice. We only meant to stay for a year, but we liked it so much that we still live there. So most of Bel was written in England.\\n\\nIn the fall of 2019, Bel was finally finished. Like McCarthy's original Lisp, it's a spec rather than an implementation, although like McCarthy's Lisp it's a spec expressed as code.\\n\\nNow that I could write essays again, I wrote a bunch about topics I'd had stacked up. I kept writing essays through 2020, but I also started to think about other things I could work on. How should I choose what to do? Well, how had I chosen what to work on in the past? I wrote an essay for myself to answer that question, and I was surprised how long and messy the answer turned out to be. If this surprised me, who'd lived it, then I thought perhaps it would be interesting to other people, and encouraging to those with similarly messy lives. So I wrote a more detailed version for others to read, and this is the last sentence of it.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNotes\\n\\n[1] My experience skipped a step in the evolution of computers: time-sharing machines with interactive OSes. I went straight from batch processing to microcomputers, which made microcomputers seem all the more exciting.\\n\\n[2] Italian words for abstract concepts can nearly always be predicted from their English cognates (except for occasional traps like polluzione). It's the everyday words that differ. So if you string together a lot of abstract concepts with a few simple verbs, you can make a little Italian go a long way.\""

                        "Answer: The author's experience with programming on the 1401 computer involved using an early version of Fortran where programs had to be typed on punch cards, stacked in the card reader, and then loaded into memory to run. The author found it challenging to work with the 1401 as the only input method was through punched cards, and without any data stored on punched cards, there were limited options for program execution. The author couldn't recall any specific programs written on the 1401 because the programs likely didn't achieve much due to the constraints of the system and the author's limited knowledge of math at that time.\n",

On the other hand, painting people presents a challenge as individuals can only sit for short periods and tend to move, requiring the artist to have a generic base to work from and then adjust it to match the specific person being painted.\n",

They discovered that it's better for technology companies to be run by product people rather than sales people, that editing code by too many people leads to bugs, that cheap office space can be detrimental if it's depressing, that planned meetings are less effective than corridor conversations, that big bureaucratic customers can pose risks, and that there's a mismatch between conventional office hours and the optimal time for programming. Additionally, the author realized that being the \"entry level\" option is advantageous in the software industry as the low end tends to dominate the high end. This understanding led the author to believe that it's beneficial to prioritize being the entry level option, even if it means sacrificing prestige, as failing to do so could result in being overshadowed by competitors.\n",

It is akin to a unique trademark that sets the artist's work apart from others. For instance, when a painting resembles a particular type of cartoon, viewers can recognize it as being created by Roy Lichtenstein. This distinctive style becomes a recognizable feature of the artist's work, making it easily identifiable and often sought after by collectors.\n",

                        "Answer: Lisp is significant as a programming language due to its unique core concept of being defined by writing an interpreter in itself. Originally conceived as a formal model of computation rather than a traditional programming language, Lisp's core idea was to have the minimum set of predefined operators needed to write an interpreter for a language within the language itself. This approach, pioneered by John McCarthy, gave Lisp a power and elegance that set it apart from other languages. Despite its humble beginnings, Lisp evolved into a full-fledged programming language with added features over time, while still retaining its foundational concept of self-interpretation.\n",

To overcome this limitation, computers were eventually used to run the interpreter, as they became powerful enough to handle the task. This shift allowed for more complicated interpreters to be tested effectively, enabling the development and refinement of the Lisp programming language.\n",

This is evident in the case of customary VC practices and the customs surrounding publishing essays, which were initially based on real constraints but have not evolved to reflect the changing landscape of startups and writing.\n",
                        "\n",
                        "In fields affected by rapid change, such as software and venture capital, customs rooted in outdated constraints can hinder progress and innovation. Being independent-minded and less influenced by these customs can provide an advantage in such rapidly changing fields. For example, the shift towards cheaper and more common startups has not been fully reflected in VC practices, highlighting the need for a more adaptable approach.\n",
                        "\n",
                        "The author's experience with Y Combinator also underscores the importance of challenging traditional customs and embracing change. By questioning established norms and being open to new ideas, individuals and organizations can better navigate evolving industries and capitalize on emerging opportunities. This flexibility and willingness to break away from outdated customs are essential for success in dynamic environments where predictability is limited.\n",

                        "Answer: The author dislikes the term 'deal flow' because it implies that the number of new startups at any given time is fixed, which the author believes is false. The purpose of Y Combinator is to falsify this notion by causing startups to be founded that would not otherwise have existed.\n",
