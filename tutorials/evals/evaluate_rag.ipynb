    "\n",
    "LLMs are trained on vast datasets, but these will not include your specific data (things like company knowledge bases and documentation). Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) addresses this by dynamically incorporating your data as context during the generation process. This is done not by altering the training data of the LLMs but by allowing the model to access and utilize your data in real-time to provide more tailored and contextually relevant responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "In RAG, your data is loaded and prepared for queries. This process is called indexing. User queries act on this index, which filters your data down to the most relevant context. This context and your query then are sent to the LLM along with a prompt, and the LLM provides a response.\n",
    "\n",
    "RAG is a critical component for building applications such a chatbots or agents and you will want to know RAG techniques on how to get data into your application.\n",

    "## Stages within RAG\n",
    "\n",
    "There are five key stages within RAG, which will in turn be a part of any larger RAG application.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Loading**: This refers to getting your data from where it lives - whether it's text files, PDFs, another website, a database or an API - into your pipeline.\n",
    "- **Indexing**: This means creating a data structure that allows for querying the data. For LLMs this nearly always means creating vector embeddings, numerical representations of the meaning of your data, as well as numerous other metadata strategies to make it easy to accurately find contextually relevant data.\n",
    "- **Storing**: Once your data is indexed, you will want to store your index, along with any other metadata, to avoid the need to re-index it.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Querying**: For any given indexing strategy there are many ways you can utilize LLMs and data structures to query, including sub-queries, multi-step queries, and hybrid strategies. \n",
    "- **Evaluation**: A critical step in any pipeline is checking how effective it is relative to other strategies, or when you make changes. Evaluation provides objective measures on how accurate, faithful, and fast your responses to queries are.\n"

       "'What I Worked On\\n\\nFebruary 2021\\n\\nBefore college the two main things I worked on, outside of school, were writing and programming. I didn\\'t write essays. I wrote what beginning writers were supposed to write then, and probably still are: short stories. My stories were awful. They had hardly any plot, just characters with strong feelings, which I imagined made them deep.\\n\\nThe first programs I tried writing were on the IBM 1401 that our school district used for what was then called \"data processing.\" This was in 9th grade, so I was 13 or 14. The school district\\'s 1401 happened to be in the basement of our junior high school, and my friend Rich Draves and I got permission to use it. It was like a mini Bond villain\\'s lair down there, with all these alien-looking machines ‚Äî CPU, disk drives, printer, card reader ‚Äî sitting up on a raised floor under bright fluorescent lights.\\n\\nThe language we used was an early version of Fortran. You had to type programs on punch cards, then stack them in the card reader and press a button to load the program into memory and run it. The result would ordinarily be to print something on the spectacularly loud printer.\\n\\nI was puzzled by the 1401. I couldn\\'t figure out what to do with it. And in retrospect there\\'s not much I could have done with it. The only form of input to programs was data stored on punched cards, and I didn\\'t have any data stored on punched cards. The only other option was to do things that didn\\'t rely on any input, like calculate approximations of pi, but I didn\\'t know enough math to do anything interesting of that type. So I\\'m not surprised I can\\'t remember any programs I wrote, because they can\\'t have done much. My clearest memory is of the moment I learned it was possible for programs not to terminate, when one of mine didn\\'t. On a machine without time-sharing, this was a social as well as a technical error, as the data center manager\\'s expression made clear.\\n\\nWith microcomputers, everything changed.'"

       "\"It felt like I was doing life right. I remember that because I was slightly dismayed at how novel it felt. The good news is that I had more moments like this over the next few years.\\n\\nIn the summer of 2016 we moved to England. We wanted our kids to see what it was like living in another country, and since I was a British citizen by birth, that seemed the obvious choice. We only meant to stay for a year, but we liked it so much that we still live there. So most of Bel was written in England.\\n\\nIn the fall of 2019, Bel was finally finished. Like McCarthy's original Lisp, it's a spec rather than an implementation, although like McCarthy's Lisp it's a spec expressed as code.\\n\\nNow that I could write essays again, I wrote a bunch about topics I'd had stacked up. I kept writing essays through 2020, but I also started to think about other things I could work on. How should I choose what to do? Well, how had I chosen what to work on in the past? I wrote an essay for myself to answer that question, and I was surprised how long and messy the answer turned out to be. If this surprised me, who'd lived it, then I thought perhaps it would be interesting to other people, and encouraging to those with similarly messy lives. So I wrote a more detailed version for others to read, and this is the last sentence of it.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNotes\\n\\n[1] My experience skipped a step in the evolution of computers: time-sharing machines with interactive OSes. I went straight from batch processing to microcomputers, which made microcomputers seem all the more exciting.\\n\\n[2] Italian words for abstract concepts can nearly always be predicted from their English cognates (except for occasional traps like polluzione). It's the everyday words that differ. So if you string together a lot of abstract concepts with a few simple verbs, you can make a little Italian go a long way.\\n\\n[3] I lived at Piazza San Felice 4, so my walk to the Accademia went straight down the spine of old Florence: past the Pitti, across the bridge, past Orsanmichele, between the Duomo and the Baptistery, and then up Via Ricasoli to Piazza San Marco.\""

      "Question: What were the two main things the author worked on before college?\n",
      "Answer: Before college, the author worked on writing and programming.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What were the limitations of the 1401 computer and why couldn't the author do much with it?\n",
      "Answer: The author mentions that the only form of input to programs on the 1401 computer was data stored on punched cards. Since the author did not have any data stored on punched cards, they did not have much they could do with the computer. Additionally, the author mentions that they did not know enough math to do anything interesting with the computer, such as calculating approximations of pi. Therefore, the limitations of the 1401 computer were the reliance on punched card input and the author's lack of knowledge in certain areas.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What was the author's first experience with computers and programming?\n",
      "Answer: The author's first experience with computers and programming was in 9th grade when they had access to an IBM 1401 computer in the basement of their junior high school. They used an early version of Fortran and had to type programs on punch cards. However, they were puzzled by the 1401 and didn't know what to do with it, as they didn't have any data stored on punched cards. They couldn't remember any programs they wrote on that machine.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What were the two things that inspired the author to work on AI?\n",
      "Answer: The two things that inspired the author to work on AI were a novel by Heinlein called The Moon is a Harsh Mistress, which featured an intelligent computer called Mike, and a PBS documentary that showed Terry Winograd using SHRDLU.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What was the author's undergraduate thesis about?\n",
      "Answer: The context information does not provide any information about the author's undergraduate thesis.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What realization did the author have during their first year of grad school regarding AI?\n",
      "Answer: The author realized that the way AI was being practiced at the time, with programs translating natural language into formal representations, was not effective in actually understanding natural language. They recognized that there was an unbridgeable gap between what these programs could do and true understanding of natural language. The author concluded that the approach of using explicit data structures to represent concepts in AI was not going to work.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What motivated the author to write a book about Lisp hacking?\n",
      "Answer: The author was motivated to write a book about Lisp hacking because writing a book about something helps in learning it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What realization did the author have while visiting the Carnegie Institute?\n",
      "Answer: The author realized that paintings were something that could be created and would last, unlike the systems work they had been doing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What was the author's initial perception of people who made art?\n",
      "Answer: The author initially perceived people who made art as a different species, either living long ago or mysterious geniuses doing strange things. The idea of actually being able to make art seemed almost miraculous to the author.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What was the author's initial plan for their dissertation topic?\n",
      "Answer: The author's initial plan for their dissertation topic was to write about applications of continuations.\n",

      "\n",
      "Question: What arrangement had the students and faculty in the painting department at the Accademia arrived at?\n",
      "Answer: The students and faculty in the painting department at the Accademia had arrived at an arrangement whereby the students wouldn't require the faculty to teach anything, and in return the faculty wouldn't require the students to learn anything.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What is the difference between painting still lives and painting people?\n",
      "Answer: Painting still lives and painting people differ in terms of the subject's ability to move. Still lives, as the name suggests, are objects that cannot move, allowing the artist to closely observe and potentially copy them pixel by pixel. On the other hand, people can only sit for a limited amount of time and tend to move, making it necessary for the artist to have a generic understanding of how to paint a person and then modify it to match the specific individual being painted.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What is the purpose of low-level processes in visual perception?\n",
      "Answer: The purpose of low-level processes in visual perception is to identify and categorize objects or elements in the environment without providing detailed information about their specific characteristics or attributes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What was the main difference between Interleaf's software and Microsoft Word?\n",

      "\n",
      "Question: What did the author learn about technology companies while working at Interleaf?\n",
      "Answer: The author learned several things about technology companies while working at Interleaf. They learned that it is better for technology companies to be run by product people rather than sales people. They also learned that it leads to bugs when code is edited by too many people, and that cheap office space is not worth it if it is depressing. Additionally, the author learned that planned meetings are inferior to corridor conversations, that big bureaucratic customers can be a dangerous source of money, and that there is not much overlap between conventional office hours and the optimal time for hacking.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: According to the author, why is it advantageous to be the 'entry level' option?\n",
      "Answer: Being the 'entry level' option is advantageous because if you're not, someone else will be, and they will surpass you and limit your growth. Additionally, being the 'entry level' option allows you to cater to a larger audience and gain more customers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What is the purpose of a signature style in painting?\n",
      "Answer: The purpose of a signature style in painting is to create a visual identity that immediately distinguishes the work as belonging to a specific artist. It serves as a way for artists to express themselves and make their work easily recognizable and unique. Additionally, having a signature style can increase the value and desirability of the artwork, as buyers are often willing to pay more for pieces that have a distinctive and recognizable style.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What motivated the author to drop out of RISD in 1993?\n",

      "\n",
      "Question: What was the initial startup idea of the author and why did it fail?\n",
      "Answer: The initial startup idea of the author was to start an investment firm with his friend Jessica and two other partners. They wanted to implement ideas they had been discussing, such as making a larger number of smaller investments and funding younger, more technical founders. However, it is not mentioned in the given context why this startup idea failed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What was the initial plan for building online stores in the summer of 1995?\n",
      "Answer: The initial plan for building online stores in the summer of 1995 was to develop normal desktop software, specifically Windows software. However, the individuals involved in the project were not familiar with writing Windows software and preferred to work in the Unix world. As a result, they decided to create a prototype store builder on Unix instead.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What is a web app and why was it considered groundbreaking at the time?\n",
      "Answer: A web app is a type of software that can be accessed and used through a web browser without the need for any additional client software or command line input on the server. It was considered groundbreaking at the time because it demonstrated that it was possible to build and control a whole store through a browser, without the need for traditional software installations or updates. This approach eliminated the need for versions, ports, and other complexities associated with traditional software development and deployment. It opened up the possibility of updating software directly on the server, making it easier to maintain and update applications. This concept of a web app paved the way for a new generation of software that could be accessed and used by users simply through a browser, without the need for additional software installations or technical expertise.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What was the significance of the deal mentioned in the context information for Y Combinator?\n",
      "Answer: The deal mentioned in the context information for Y Combinator was significant because it provided funding for startups in return for a percentage of equity. This deal allowed Y Combinator to scale startup funding by investing in batches of startups, which was more convenient for Y Combinator and provided a supportive community for the founders. Additionally, the deal created a network effect among the startups, with many of them becoming customers of each other.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: Who did Robert recommend as a programmer to recruit?\n",

      "\n",
      "Question: What is the concept of 'doing things that don't scale' and how did the author apply it in their startup?\n",
      "Answer: The concept of 'doing things that don't scale' refers to taking unconventional or inefficient measures in the early stages of a startup in order to acquire users or customers. The author applied this concept in their startup by building stores for users, despite the fact that their software was designed for users to create their own stores. This approach may have seemed humiliating, but it was necessary to attract users and learn more about retail and how users interacted with their software. The author believed that, at that stage, there was nothing more important than getting users, even if it meant doing things that were not scalable in the long term.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What is the ultimate test of a startup's success according to the author?\n",
      "Answer: The ultimate test of a startup's success, according to the author, is its growth rate.\n",

The author mentions that their Viaweb stock was valuable in principle, but they were not sure how to value a business. Additionally, the author was constantly aware of the near-death experiences the company faced. Therefore, when Yahoo bought the company, it felt like going from a state of financial uncertainty to a state of wealth.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: Why did the author leave Yahoo after their options vested?\n",
      "Answer: The author left Yahoo after their options vested because they had initially joined the company with the goal of getting rich so they could pursue their passion for painting. Now that they had become rich, they decided it was time to leave and focus on their artistic pursuits.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: Why did the author advise founders who sell their companies to take a vacation?\n",
      "Answer: The author advises founders who sell their companies to take a vacation because the author regrets not taking a break after leaving Yahoo to pursue painting. The author believes that taking a vacation would have been beneficial to recharge and relax before starting a new venture.\n",

      "Answer: In the print era, the channel for publishing essays was vanishingly small. Only a few officially anointed thinkers who went to the right parties in New York and specialists writing about their specialties were allowed to publish essays. This limited access meant that many essays that could have been written were never published due to the lack of a way to publish them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What is the significance of Lisp in the author's writing and how does it compare to Latin?\n",
      "Answer: The author finds Lisp significant because of its origins as a model of computation and its power and elegance as a programming language. The author was attracted to Lisp in college, although they didn't fully understand why at the time. Lisp's core is a language defined by writing an interpreter in itself, which sets it apart from other programming languages. In contrast, Latin is not mentioned in the given context, so it is not possible to compare Lisp to Latin based on the provided information.\n",

      "Question: What was the purpose of organizing a summer program for undergrads to start startups?\n",
      "Answer: The purpose of organizing a summer program for undergrads to start startups was to provide them with a more interesting summer experience than working at companies like Microsoft. Additionally, it allowed the organizers to practice being investors and gain experience in the startup ecosystem.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: Who were some of the notable individuals in the first batch of the Summer Founders Program?\n",
      "Answer: Some of the notable individuals in the first batch of the Summer Founders Program were reddit, Justin Kan and Emmett Shear (who went on to found Twitch), Aaron Swartz (who had already helped write the RSS spec and would later become a martyr for open access), and Sam Altman (who would later become the second president of YC).\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What are some advantages of scale that YC noticed as it grew?\n",
      "Answer: YC noticed several advantages of scale as it grew. One advantage was that the alumni became a tight community, dedicated to helping one another and especially the current batch. Another advantage was that the startups in the program started to become each other's customers. YC also noticed that many startups were getting their initial set of customers almost entirely from among their batchmates.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: Why did the author change the name of the platform to Hacker News?\n",
      "Answer: The author changed the name of the platform to Hacker News because they wanted to reach future startup founders, not just current startup founders. They believed that the name \"Hacker News\" would be more appealing and engaging to those who had an intellectual curiosity, rather than focusing solely on startups.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What made YC different from other kinds of work the author had done?\n",
      "Answer: The problems in YC came to the author instead of the author deciding what to work on.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: Why did Rtm offer unsolicited advice to the author?\n",
      "Answer: Rtm offered unsolicited advice to the author because he wanted to make sure that Y Combinator wasn't the last cool thing the author did.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: Why did the founders of YC decide to recruit Sam Altman as the new president?\n",
      "Answer: The founders of YC decided to recruit Sam Altman as the new president because they wanted YC to last for a long time and believed that it couldn't be controlled by the founders. They wanted to make a complete changing of the guard and let Sam Altman reorganize YC. Initially, Sam Altman said no to the offer as he wanted to start a startup to make nuclear reactors, but after persistent persuasion, he finally agreed in October 2013.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What did the author decide to do after stopping work on YC?\n",
      "Answer: After stopping work on YC, the author decided to start painting. They wanted to see how good they could get at painting if they really focused on it. They spent most of the rest of 2014 painting, and although they got better, they felt they were not good enough. However, in November, they ran out of steam and stopped working on their painting.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What is the distinctive feature of Lisp that sets it apart from other programming languages?\n",
      "Answer: Lisp is distinctive because its core is a language defined by writing an interpreter in itself. It was originally intended as a formal model of computation, rather than a programming language in the ordinary sense. This feature gives Lisp a power and elegance that other languages cannot match.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What was the reason why McCarthy's original axiomatic approach couldn't be used to define the added features?\n",
      "Answer: The reason why McCarthy's original axiomatic approach couldn't be used to define the added features is because it wouldn't have been feasible at the time. McCarthy tested his interpreter by hand-simulating the execution of programs, but as the interpreters became more complicated, it would have been necessary to run them on computers. However, computers at that time were not powerful enough to handle the more complex interpreters.\n",

      "Question: What is the difference between rent-controlled and rent-stabilized apartments?\n",
      "Answer: Rent-controlled and rent-stabilized apartments are two different types of regulations that govern the pricing of rental units. Rent-controlled apartments typically have stricter regulations and are subject to more stringent rent control laws. These laws limit the amount that landlords can increase the rent each year and provide more protection for tenants against eviction. Rent-stabilized apartments, on the other hand, have less strict regulations and are subject to rent stabilization laws. These laws allow for moderate rent increases each year and provide some protection for tenants against eviction. While both types of apartments offer some level of rent protection, rent-controlled apartments generally offer more extensive protections than rent-stabilized apartments.\n",

      "Question: Describe the arrangement between the students and faculty in the painting department at the Accademia.\n",
      "Answer: The arrangement between the students and faculty in the painting department at the Accademia is such that the students do not require the faculty to teach anything, and in return, the faculty does not require the students to learn anything. Despite this arrangement, both the students and faculty outwardly adhere to the conventions of a 19th-century atelier.\n",

      "Question: What is the difference between painting still lives and painting people?\n",
      "Answer: Painting still lives and painting people differ in terms of the subject's ability to move. Still lives, as the name suggests, are objects that cannot move, allowing the artist to closely observe and potentially copy them pixel by pixel. On the other hand, people can only sit for a limited amount of time and tend to move, making it necessary for the artist to have a generic understanding of how to paint a person and then modify it to match the specific individual being painted.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What does the author mean by 'emphasizing the visual cues' in a still life painting?\n",
      "Answer: By 'emphasizing the visual cues' in a still life painting, the author means highlighting the details and characteristics that indicate certain aspects of the objects being painted. This could include features like the sudden change in color at the edge of an object, which signifies its boundary. The author suggests that by subtly emphasizing these visual cues, the artist can create paintings that are more realistic than photographs, not just in a metaphorical sense, but in terms of conveying detailed information about the objects being depicted.\n",

      "Question: In the context of art school, what is a 'signature style' and why do buyers pay a lot for such work?\n",
      "Answer: A 'signature style' in the context of art school refers to a visual style that immediately identifies the work as belonging to a specific artist. It is something unique and distinctive that sets the artist's work apart from others. Buyers often pay a lot for artwork with a signature style because it carries the artist's personal brand and is seen as a mark of quality and originality. It becomes a recognizable and sought-after characteristic that adds value to the artwork.\n",

      "\n",
      "Question: What was the author's startup idea and why was it not successful?\n",
      "Answer: The author's startup idea was to start their own investment firm and implement the ideas they had been discussing. However, the startup idea was not successful because they had no prior knowledge or experience in angel investing, and there were no mentors or experts available to learn from at that time. Despite their ignorance, they made what seemed like obvious choices and some of their decisions turned out to be novel.\n",

      "\n",
      "Question: What features did the WYSIWYG site builder have and how did it differ from traditional static pages?\n",
      "Answer: The WYSIWYG site builder had the feature of allowing users to create pages that looked exactly like the static ones that would be generated later. However, instead of leading to static pages, the links in the WYSIWYG site builder referred to closures stored in a hash table on the server. This differed from traditional static pages, where the links would directly lead to separate static pages.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: How did the author's background in art help in building an online store builder?\n",
      "Answer: The author's background in art did not directly help in building an online store builder. The author initially started a company to put art galleries online, but this idea did not succeed. It was only later, after realizing that online stores were similar to the sites they had been generating for galleries, that they decided to focus on building an online store builder. The author's background in art did not play a significant role in this shift in focus.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What was the state of online stores when the business opened in January 1996?\n",
      "Answer: The state of online stores when the business opened in January 1996 was still in its early stages. The concept of building online stores was relatively new, and the founders of the business were trying to develop software to create these stores. They initially planned to create desktop software for Windows, but later decided to build a prototype store builder on Unix. The idea of running the software on the server and allowing users to control it through their browsers was a breakthrough, as it eliminated the need for client software on users' computers. The founders believed they were onto something innovative and saw the potential for a new generation of software that could be updated directly on the server.\n",

      "Question: What did the author learn about retail and the importance of growth rate in a startup?\n",
      "Answer: The author learned about retail through the experience of building stores for users. They discovered that certain details, such as having a closeup of the collar of a man's shirt, were more effective in attracting users. Additionally, the author realized that growth rate is the ultimate test of a startup. They initially believed that the absolute number of users was the most important factor, but they later understood that the growth rate takes care of the absolute number in the long term.\n",

      "Question: How did the author feel when Yahoo bought their company?\n",
      "Answer: The author felt a huge relief when Yahoo bought their company. They considered their Viaweb stock to be valuable in principle, but they personally did not feel it was very valuable. They were all too aware of the near-death experiences they had every few months and had not significantly changed their lifestyle since starting the company. Therefore, when Yahoo bought them, it felt like going from rags to riches for the author.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: Why did the author leave Yahoo after their options vested?\n",
      "Answer: The author left Yahoo after their options vested because they had initially joined the company with the goal of getting rich so they could pursue their passion for painting. Now that they had become rich, they decided it was time to leave and focus on their artistic pursuits.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What hindered the author's ability to paint after leaving Yahoo?\n",
      "Answer: The author's lack of energy and ambition hindered their ability to paint after leaving Yahoo. Additionally, not knowing many people in California and living in a remote location in the Santa Cruz Mountains also contributed to the difficulty in pursuing their painting endeavors.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: How did the author's life change after becoming rich?\n",
      "Answer: After becoming rich, the author's life changed significantly. They were able to resume their old life in New York, but with the added luxury of being able to easily hail taxis and dine at charming restaurants. They also experimented with a new style of painting and looked for an apartment to buy. However, despite their newfound wealth, the author struggled with their energy and ambition to paint, partly due to not knowing many people in California and living in a remote location in the Santa Cruz Mountains.\n",

      "\n",
      "Question: Why did the author realize that there would be a whole new generation of essays?\n",
      "Answer: The author realized that there would be a whole new generation of essays because the advent of the internet and the ability to publish essays online meant that there was now a way to publish essays that had never been written before. In the print era, the channel for publishing essays was very limited, and only a few officially anointed thinkers were allowed to publish essays. However, with the internet, anyone could publish anything, opening up the opportunity for a whole new generation of essays to be written and shared.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: According to the author, what is the significance of being drawn to work that lacks prestige?\n",
      "Answer: Being drawn to work that lacks prestige is significant because it indicates that there is something real to be discovered in that field and that the individual has the right kind of motives. It suggests that the person is not driven by impure motives such as the desire to impress others. While working on unprestigious work does not guarantee that one is on the right track, it at least ensures that they are not on the most common type of wrong one.\n",

      "Question: Why did Y Combinator not organize itself as a fund and how did they fund it initially?\n",
      "Answer: Y Combinator did not organize itself as a fund because the founders did not have knowledge of how VC firms were organized and it never occurred to them to try to raise a fund. Instead, they funded Y Combinator with their own money.\n",

      "Question: What were the initial intentions of the founder of YC and how did they change over time?\n",
      "Answer: The founder of YC initially intended to do three things: hack, write essays, and work on YC. However, as YC grew and the founder became more excited about it, YC started to take up more than a third of their attention. This suggests that the founder's initial intentions for YC changed over time, as they became more focused on growing and developing the program.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: Why was Hacker News the biggest source of stress for the author?\n",
      "Answer: The author states that Hacker News (HN) was the biggest source of stress for them. They mention that if all they had to do was select and help founders, life would have been easier. This implies that HN was a mistake and that the biggest source of stress in one's work should be something close to the core of the work. The author compares themselves to someone in pain while running a marathon not from the exertion of running, but because of a blister from an ill-fitting shoe. Therefore, it can be inferred that HN caused a significant amount of stress for the author because it was not directly related to their core work of selecting and helping founders.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What were the two main projects the author focused on while working at YC?\n",

      "\n",
      "Question: Why did the author decide to hand over Y Combinator to someone else?\n",
      "Answer: The author decided to hand over Y Combinator to someone else because they wanted YC to last for a long time and believed that it couldn't be controlled by the founders. They wanted to make a complete changing of the guard and ensure the long-term success of YC. Initially, the author asked Jessica if she wanted to be president, but she declined. So, they decided to try to recruit Sam Altman. After some persistence, Sam eventually agreed to take over as president of YC.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What did the author decide to do after leaving YC and why did they choose that activity?\n",
      "Answer: After leaving YC, the author decided to hand over YC to someone else and recruit Sam Altman as the new president.

      "Question: What is the distinctive feature of Lisp as mentioned in the context?\n",
      "Answer: The distinctive feature of Lisp, as mentioned in the context, is that its core is a language defined by writing an interpreter in itself.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: Why was it not feasible to define the additional features of Lisp using McCarthy's original axiomatic approach?\n",
      "Answer: It was not feasible to define the additional features of Lisp using McCarthy's original axiomatic approach because it was already getting close to the limit of interpreters that could be tested by hand-simulating the execution of programs. Additionally, computers at that time were not powerful enough to run a more complicated interpreter.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What challenges did the author face while writing the new Lisp, Bel, in itself in Arc?\n",
      "Answer: The author faced challenges in understanding the code of Bel because it was convoluted and difficult to keep track of what was happening at what level.

The author also had to ban themselves from writing essays during most of the time they were working on Bel in order to focus on completing the project.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: Where was most of Bel written and why did the author choose that location?\n",
      "Answer: Most of Bel was written in England. The author chose to write it there because they moved to England in the summer of 2016 and intended to stay for a year. However, they liked it so much that they decided to continue living there. Therefore, since they were living in England, it became the obvious choice for them to write most of Bel.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: Describe the author's thought process in choosing what to work on and why they decided to write an essay about it.\n",
      "Answer: The author's thought process in choosing what to work on was influenced by their realization that unprestigious types of work often lead to real discoveries. They believed that working on things that weren't prestigious could help them avoid the desire to impress others and stay on the right track.

Along this route, the author observed Florence at street level in various conditions, ranging from empty dark winter evenings to sweltering summer days when the streets were crowded with tourists.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: Why did the software for an online store builder need to be launched privately before launching publicly?\n",
      "Answer: The software for the online store builder needed to be launched privately before launching publicly in order to test and refine the product. By launching privately, the company could gather feedback from a smaller group of users and make necessary improvements or fixes before releasing it to a larger audience. This approach allowed them to ensure that the software was functioning properly and meeting the needs of the users before making it available to the public.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: Why did the author choose the name 'Y Combinator' for their startup?\n",

I didn't have a word of my dissertation written, but in what must have been the quickest bit of thinking in my life, I decided to take a shot at writing one in the 5 weeks or so that remained before the deadline, reusing parts of On Lisp where I could, and I was able to respond, with no perceptible delay \"Yes, I think so.

      "I'm only up to age 25 and already there are such conspicuous patterns. Here I was, yet again about to attend some august institution in the hopes of learning about some prestigious subject, and yet again about to be disappointed. The students and faculty in the painting department at the Accademia were the nicest people you could imagine, but they had long since arrived at an arrangement whereby the students wouldn't require the faculty to teach anything, and in return the faculty wouldn't require the students to learn anything. And at the same time all involved would adhere outwardly to the conventions of a 19th century atelier. We actually had one of those little stoves, fed with kindling, that you see in 19th century studio paintings, and a nude model sitting as close to it as possible without getting burned. Except hardly anyone else painted her besides me. The rest of the students spent their time chatting or occasionally trying to imitate things they'd seen in American art magazines.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our model turned out to live just down the street from me. She made a living from a combination of modelling and making fakes for a local antique dealer. She'd copy an obscure old painting out of a book, and then he'd take the copy and maltreat it to make it look old. [3]\n",
      "\n",
      "While I was a student at the Accademia I started painting still lives in my bedroom at night. These paintings were tiny, because the room was, and because I painted them on leftover scraps of canvas, which was all I could afford at the time. Painting still lives is different from painting people, because the subject, as its name suggests, can't move. People can't sit for more than about 15 minutes at a time, and when they do they don't sit very still. So the traditional m.o. for painting people is to know how to paint a generic person, which you then modify to match the specific person you're painting. Whereas a still life you can, if you want, copy pixel by pixel from what you're seeing. You don't want to stop there, of course, or you get merely photographic accuracy, and what makes a still life interesting is that it's been through a head.\n",

      "Before college the two main things I worked on, outside of school, were writing and programming. I didn't write essays. I wrote what beginning writers were supposed to write then, and probably still are: short stories. My stories were awful. They had hardly any plot, just characters with strong feelings, which I imagined made them deep.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first programs I tried writing were on the IBM 1401 that our school district used for what was then called \"data processing.\" This was in 9th grade, so I was 13 or 14. The school district's 1401 happened to be in the basement of our junior high school, and my friend Rich Draves and I got permission to use it. It was like a mini Bond villain's lair down there, with all these alien-looking machines ‚Äî CPU, disk drives, printer, card reader ‚Äî sitting up on a raised floor under bright fluorescent lights.\n",
      "\n",
      "The language we used was an early version of Fortran. You had to type programs on punch cards, then stack them in the card reader and press a button to load the program into memory and run it. The result would ordinarily be to print something on the spectacularly loud printer.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was puzzled by the 1401. I couldn't figure out what to do with it. And in retrospect there's not much I could have done with it. The only form of input to programs was data stored on punched cards, and I didn't have any data stored on punched cards. The only other option was to do things that didn't rely on any input, like calculate approximations of pi, but I didn't know enough math to do anything interesting of that type. So I'm not surprised I can't remember any programs I wrote, because they can't have done much. My clearest memory is of the moment I learned it was possible for programs not to terminate, when one of mine didn't. On a machine without time-sharing, this was a social as well as a technical error, as the data center manager's expression made clear.\n",

I haven't tried rereading The Moon is a Harsh Mistress, so I don't know how well it has aged, but when I read it I was drawn entirely into its world. It seemed only a matter of time before we'd have Mike, and when I saw Winograd using SHRDLU, it seemed like that time would be a few years at most. All you had to do was teach SHRDLU more words.\n",

I didn't have a word of my dissertation written, but in what must have been the quickest bit of thinking in my life, I decided to take a shot at writing one in the 5 weeks or so that remained before the deadline, reusing parts of On Lisp where I could, and I was able to respond, with no perceptible delay \"Yes, I think so. I'll give you something to read in a few days.\"\n",

      "Meanwhile I was applying to art schools. I applied to two: RISD in the US, and the Accademia di Belli Arti in Florence, which, because it was the oldest art school, I imagined would be good. RISD accepted me, and I never heard back from the Accademia, so off to Providence I went.\n",

      "I'd applied for the BFA program at RISD, which meant in effect that I had to go to college again. This was not as strange as it sounds, because I was only 25, and art schools are full of people of different ages. RISD counted me as a transfer sophomore and said I had to do the foundation that summer. The foundation means the classes that everyone has to take in fundamental subjects like drawing, color, and design.\n",

      "Toward the end of the summer I got a big surprise: a letter from the Accademia, which had been delayed because they'd sent it to Cambridge England instead of Cambridge Massachusetts, inviting me to take the entrance exam in Florence that fall. This was now only weeks away. My nice landlady let me leave my stuff in her attic. I had some money saved from consulting work I'd done in grad school; there was probably enough to last a year if I lived cheaply. Now all I had to do was learn Italian.\n",

      "    [Reference]: Now you not only had colleagues, but colleagues who understood the problems you were facing and could tell you how they were solving them.\n",
      "\n",
      "As YC grew, we started to notice other advantages of scale. The alumni became a tight community, dedicated to helping one another, and especially the current batch, whose shoes they remembered being in. We also noticed that the startups were becoming one another's customers. We used to refer jokingly to the \"YC GDP,\" but as YC grows this becomes less and less of a joke. Now lots of startups get their initial set of customers almost entirely from among their batchmates.\n",
      "\n",
      "I had not originally intended YC to be a full-time job. I was going to do three things: hack, write essays, and work on YC. As YC grew, and I grew more excited about it, it started to take up a lot more than a third of my attention. But for the first few years I was still able to work on other things.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the summer of 2006, Robert and I started working on a new version of Arc. This one was reasonably fast, because it was compiled into Scheme. To test this new Arc, I wrote Hacker News in it. It was originally meant to be a news aggregator for startup founders and was called Startup News, but after a few months I got tired of reading about nothing but startups. Plus it wasn't startup founders we wanted to reach. It was future startup founders. So I changed the name to Hacker News and the topic to whatever engaged one's intellectual curiosity.\n",
      "\n",
      "HN was no doubt good for YC, but it was also by far the biggest source of stress for me. If all I'd had to do was select and help founders, life would have been so easy. And that implies that HN was a mistake. Surely the biggest source of stress in one's work should at least be something close to the core of the work. Whereas I was like someone who was in pain while running a marathon not from the exertion of running, but because I had a blister from an ill-fitting shoe. When I was dealing with some urgent problem during YC, there was about a 60% chance it had to do with HN, and a 40% chance it had do with everything else combined.\n",
      "\n",
      "They were an impressive group. That first batch included reddit, Justin Kan and Emmett Shear, who went on to found Twitch, Aaron Swartz, who had already helped write the RSS spec and would a few years later become a martyr for open access, and Sam Altman, who would later become the second president of YC. I don't think it was entirely luck that the first batch was so good. You had to be pretty bold to sign up for a weird thing like the Summer Founders Program instead of a summer job at a legit place like Microsoft or Goldman Sachs.\n",
      "\n",
      "The deal for startups was based on a combination of the deal we did with Julian ($10k for 10%) and what Robert said MIT grad students got for the summer ($6k). We invested $6k per founder, which in the typical two-founder case was $12k, in return for 6%. That had to be fair, because it was twice as good as the deal we ourselves had taken. Plus that first summer, which was really hot, Jessica brought the founders free air conditioners. [16]\n",
      "\n",
      "Fairly quickly I realized that we had stumbled upon the way to scale startup funding. Funding startups in batches was more convenient for us, because it meant we could do things for a lot of startups at once, but being part of a batch was better for the startups too. It solved one of the biggest problems faced by founders: the isolation. Now you not only had colleagues, but colleagues who understood the problems you were facing and could tell you how they were solving them.\n",

      "The distinctive thing about Lisp is that its core is a language defined by writing an interpreter in itself. It wasn't originally intended as a programming language in the ordinary sense. It was meant to be a formal model of computation, an alternative to the Turing machine. If you want to write an interpreter for a language in itself, what's the minimum set of predefined operators you need? The Lisp that John McCarthy invented, or more accurately discovered, is an answer to that question. [19]\n",
      "\n",
      "McCarthy didn't realize this Lisp could even be used to program computers till his grad student Steve Russell suggested it. Russell translated McCarthy's interpreter into IBM 704 machine language, and from that point Lisp started also to be a programming language in the ordinary sense. But its origins as a model of computation gave it a power and elegance that other languages couldn't match. It was this that attracted me in college, though I didn't understand why at the time.\n",
      "\n",
      "McCarthy's 1960 Lisp did nothing more than interpret Lisp expressions. It was missing a lot of things you'd want in a programming language. So these had to be added, and when they were, they weren't defined using McCarthy's original axiomatic approach. That wouldn't have been feasible at the time. McCarthy tested his interpreter by hand-simulating the execution of programs. But it was already getting close to the limit of interpreters you could test that way ‚Äî indeed, there was a bug in it that McCarthy had overlooked. To test a more complicated interpreter, you'd have had to run it, and computers then weren't powerful enough.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now they are, though. Now you could continue using McCarthy's axiomatic approach till you'd defined a complete programming language. And as long as every change you made to McCarthy's Lisp was a discoveredness-preserving transformation, you could, in principle, end up with a complete language that had this quality. Harder to do than to talk about, of course, but if it was possible in principle, why not try?\n",
      "\n",
      "So I decided to focus on Lisp. In fact, I decided to write a book about Lisp hacking. It's scary to think how little I knew about Lisp hacking when I started writing that book. But there's nothing like writing a book about something to help you learn it. The book, On Lisp, wasn't published till 1993, but I wrote much of it in grad school.\n",
      "\n",
      "Computer Science is an uneasy alliance between two halves, theory and systems. The theory people prove things, and the systems people build things. I wanted to build things. I had plenty of respect for theory ‚Äî indeed, a sneaking suspicion that it was the more admirable of the two halves ‚Äî but building things seemed so much more exciting.\n",
      "\n",
      "The problem with systems work, though, was that it didn't last. Any program you wrote today, no matter how good, would be obsolete in a couple decades at best. People might mention your software in footnotes, but no one would actually use it. And indeed, it would seem very feeble work. Only people with a sense of the history of the field would even realize that, in its time, it had been good.\n",
      "\n",
      "There were some surplus Xerox Dandelions floating around the computer lab at one point. Anyone who wanted one to play around with could have one. I was briefly tempted, but they were so slow by present standards; what was the point? No one else wanted one either, so off they went. That was what happened to systems work.\n",

      "In this dissatisfied state I went in 1988 to visit Rich Draves at CMU, where he was in grad school. One day I went to visit the Carnegie Institute, where I'd spent a lot of time as a kid. While looking at a painting there I realized something that might seem obvious, but was a big surprise to me. There, right on the wall, was something you could make that would last.

      "Around this time, in the spring of 2000, I had an idea. It was clear from our experience with Viaweb that web apps were the future. Why not build a web app for making web apps? Why not let people edit code on our server through the browser, and then host the resulting applications for them? [9] You could run all sorts of services on the servers that these applications could use just by making an API call: making and receiving phone calls, manipulating images, taking credit card payments, etc.\n",

I didn't particularly want to start another company, but it was clear that this idea would have to be embodied as one, so I decided to move to Cambridge and start it. I hoped to lure Robert into working on it with me, but there I ran into a hitch. Robert was now a postdoc at MIT, and though he'd made a lot of money the last time I'd lured him into working on one of my schemes, it had also been a huge time sink.

I wrote an essay for myself to answer that question, and I was surprised how long and messy the answer turned out to be. If this surprised me, who'd lived it, then I thought perhaps it would be interesting to other people, and encouraging to those with similarly messy lives.

      "We did a lot of things right by accident like that. For example, we did what's now called \"doing things that don't scale,\" although at the time we would have described it as \"being so lame that we're driven to the most desperate measures to get users.\" The most common of which was building stores for them. This seemed particularly humiliating, since the whole raison d'etre of our software was that people could use it to make their own stores. But anything to get users.\n",

      "We learned a lot more about retail than we wanted to know. For example, that if you could only have a small image of a man's shirt (and all images were small then by present standards), it was better to have a closeup of the collar than a picture of the whole shirt. The reason I remember learning this was that it meant I had to rescan about 30 images of men's shirts. My first set of scans were so beautiful too.\n",
      "\n",
      "Though this felt wrong, it was exactly the right thing to be doing. Building stores for users taught us about retail, and about how it felt to use our software. I was initially both mystified and repelled by \"business\" and thought we needed a \"business person\" to be in charge of it, but once we started to get users, I was converted, in much the same way I was converted to fatherhood once I had kids. Whatever users wanted, I was all theirs. Maybe one day we'd have so many users that I couldn't scan their images for them, but in the meantime there was nothing more important to do.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another thing I didn't get at the time is that growth rate is the ultimate test of a startup. Our growth rate was fine. We had about 70 stores at the end of 1996 and about 500 at the end of 1997. I mistakenly thought the thing that mattered was the absolute number of users. And that is the thing that matters in the sense that that's how much money you're making, and if you're not making enough, you might go out of business. But in the long term the growth rate takes care of the absolute number.\n",

Now lots of startups get their initial set of customers almost entirely from among their batchmates.\n",

      "In the summer of 2006, Robert and I started working on a new version of Arc. This one was reasonably fast, because it was compiled into Scheme. To test this new Arc, I wrote Hacker News in it. It was originally meant to be a news aggregator for startup founders and was called Startup News, but after a few months I got tired of reading about nothing but startups. Plus it wasn't startup founders we wanted to reach. It was future startup founders. So I changed the name to Hacker News and the topic to whatever engaged one's intellectual curiosity.\n",
      "\n",
      "HN was no doubt good for YC, but it was also by far the biggest source of stress for me. If all I'd had to do was select and help founders, life would have been so easy. And that implies that HN was a mistake. Surely the biggest source of stress in one's work should at least be something close to the core of the work. Whereas I was like someone who was in pain while running a marathon not from the exertion of running, but because I had a blister from an ill-fitting shoe. When I was dealing with some urgent problem during YC, there was about a 60% chance it had to do with HN, and a 40% chance it had do with everything else combined.\n",

The author applied this concept in their startup by building stores for users, despite the fact that their software was designed for users to create their own stores. This approach may have seemed humiliating, but it was necessary to attract users and learn more about retail and how users interacted with their software. The author believed that, at that stage, there was nothing more important than getting users, even if it meant doing things that were not scalable in the long term.\n",

We charged $100 a month for a small store and $300 a month for a big one.

I hoped to lure Robert into working on it with me, but there I ran into a hitch.

      "The deal for startups was based on a combination of the deal we did with Julian ($10k for 10%) and what Robert said MIT grad students got for the summer ($6k). We invested $6k per founder, which in the typical two-founder case was $12k, in return for 6%. That had to be fair, because it was twice as good as the deal we ourselves had taken.

And there were angels, who did smaller investments, but these were individuals who were usually focused on other things and made investments on the side. And neither of them helped founders enough in the beginning. We knew how helpless founders were in some respects, because we remembered how helpless we'd been. For example, one thing Julian had done for us that seemed to us like magic was to get us set up as a company. We were fine writing fairly difficult software, but actually getting incorporated, with bylaws and stock and all that stuff, how on earth did you do that? Our plan was not only to make seed investments, but to do for startups everything Julian had done for us.\n",

      "So in the summer of 1995, after I submitted the camera-ready copy of ANSI Common Lisp to the publishers, we started trying to write software to build online stores. At first this was going to be normal desktop software, which in those days meant Windows software. That was an alarming prospect, because neither of us knew how to write Windows software or wanted to learn. We lived in the Unix world. But we decided we'd at least try writing a prototype store builder on Unix. Robert wrote a shopping cart, and I wrote a new site generator for stores ‚Äî in Lisp, of course.\n",
      "\n",
      "We were working out of Robert's apartment in Cambridge. His roommate was away for big chunks of time, during which I got to sleep in his room. For some reason there was no bed frame or sheets, just a mattress on the floor. One morning as I was lying on this mattress I had an idea that made me sit up like a capital L. What if we ran the software on the server, and let users control it by clicking on links? Then we'd never have to write anything to run on users' computers. We could generate the sites on the same server we'd serve them from. Users wouldn't need anything more than a browser.\n",
      "\n",
      "This kind of software, known as a web app, is common now, but at the time it wasn't clear that it was even possible. To find out, we decided to try making a version of our store builder that you could control through the browser. A couple days later, on August 12, we had one that worked. The UI was horrible, but it proved you could build a whole store through the browser, without any client software or typing anything into the command line on the server.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now we felt like we were really onto something. I had visions of a whole new generation of software working this way. You wouldn't need versions, or ports, or any of that crap.

Now you could just update the software right on the server.\n",

      "If I wanted to get rich, here was the next train leaving the station. I was right about that part. What I got wrong was the idea. I decided we should start a company to put art galleries online. I can't honestly say, after reading so many Y Combinator applications, that this was the worst startup idea ever, but it was up there. Art galleries didn't want to be online, and still don't, not the fancy ones. That's not how they sell. I wrote some software to generate web sites for galleries, and Robert wrote some to resize images and set up an http server to serve the pages. Then we tried to sign up galleries. To call this a difficult sale would be an understatement. It was difficult to give away. A few galleries let us make sites for them for free, but none paid us.\n",

That was an alarming prospect, because neither of us knew how to write Windows software or wanted to learn. We lived in the Unix world. But we decided we'd at least try writing a prototype store builder on Unix. Robert wrote a shopping cart, and I wrote a new site generator for stores ‚Äî in Lisp, of course.\n",

      "The distinctive thing about Lisp is that its core is a language defined by writing an interpreter in itself. It wasn't originally intended as a programming language in the ordinary sense. It was meant to be a formal model of computation, an alternative to the Turing machine. If you want to write an interpreter for a language in itself, what's the minimum set of predefined operators you need? The Lisp that John McCarthy invented, or more accurately discovered, is an answer to that question. [19]\n",
      "\n",
      "McCarthy didn't realize this Lisp could even be used to program computers till his grad student Steve Russell suggested it. Russell translated McCarthy's interpreter into IBM 704 machine language, and from that point Lisp started also to be a programming language in the ordinary sense. But its origins as a model of computation gave it a power and elegance that other languages couldn't match. It was this that attracted me in college, though I didn't understand why at the time.\n",
      "\n",
      "McCarthy's 1960 Lisp did nothing more than interpret Lisp expressions. It was missing a lot of things you'd want in a programming language. So these had to be added, and when they were, they weren't defined using McCarthy's original axiomatic approach. That wouldn't have been feasible at the time. McCarthy tested his interpreter by hand-simulating the execution of programs. But it was already getting close to the limit of interpreters you could test that way ‚Äî indeed, there was a bug in it that McCarthy had overlooked. To test a more complicated interpreter, you'd have had to run it, and computers then weren't powerful enough.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now they are, though. Now you could continue using McCarthy's axiomatic approach till you'd defined a complete programming language. And as long as every change you made to McCarthy's Lisp was a discoveredness-preserving transformation, you could, in principle, end up with a complete language that had this quality. Harder to do than to talk about, of course, but if it was possible in principle, why not try?\n",
