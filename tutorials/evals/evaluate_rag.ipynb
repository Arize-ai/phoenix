    "\n",
    "LLMs are trained on vast datasets, but these will not include your specific data (things like company knowledge bases and documentation). Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) addresses this by dynamically incorporating your data as context during the generation process. This is done not by altering the training data of the LLMs but by allowing the model to access and utilize your data in real-time to provide more tailored and contextually relevant responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "In RAG, your data is loaded and prepared for queries. This process is called indexing. User queries act on this index, which filters your data down to the most relevant context. This context and your query then are sent to the LLM along with a prompt, and the LLM provides a response.\n",
    "\n",
    "RAG is a critical component for building applications such a chatbots or agents and you will want to know RAG techniques on how to get data into your application.\n",

    "## Stages within RAG\n",
    "\n",
    "There are five key stages within RAG, which will in turn be a part of any larger RAG application.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Loading**: This refers to getting your data from where it lives - whether it's text files, PDFs, another website, a database or an API - into your pipeline.\n",
    "- **Indexing**: This means creating a data structure that allows for querying the data. For LLMs this nearly always means creating vector embeddings, numerical representations of the meaning of your data, as well as numerous other metadata strategies to make it easy to accurately find contextually relevant data.\n",
    "- **Storing**: Once your data is indexed, you will want to store your index, along with any other metadata, to avoid the need to re-index it.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Querying**: For any given indexing strategy there are many ways you can utilize LLMs and data structures to query, including sub-queries, multi-step queries, and hybrid strategies. \n",
    "- **Evaluation**: A critical step in any pipeline is checking how effective it is relative to other strategies, or when you make changes. Evaluation provides objective measures on how accurate, faithful, and fast your responses to queries are.\n"

       "'What I Worked On\\n\\nFebruary 2021\\n\\nBefore college the two main things I worked on, outside of school, were writing and programming. I didn\\'t write essays. I wrote what beginning writers were supposed to write then, and probably still are: short stories. My stories were awful. They had hardly any plot, just characters with strong feelings, which I imagined made them deep.\\n\\nThe first programs I tried writing were on the IBM 1401 that our school district used for what was then called \"data processing.\" This was in 9th grade, so I was 13 or 14. The school district\\'s 1401 happened to be in the basement of our junior high school, and my friend Rich Draves and I got permission to use it. It was like a mini Bond villain\\'s lair down there, with all these alien-looking machines ‚Äî CPU, disk drives, printer, card reader ‚Äî sitting up on a raised floor under bright fluorescent lights.\\n\\nThe language we used was an early version of Fortran. You had to type programs on punch cards, then stack them in the card reader and press a button to load the program into memory and run it. The result would ordinarily be to print something on the spectacularly loud printer.\\n\\nI was puzzled by the 1401. I couldn\\'t figure out what to do with it. And in retrospect there\\'s not much I could have done with it. The only form of input to programs was data stored on punched cards, and I didn\\'t have any data stored on punched cards. The only other option was to do things that didn\\'t rely on any input, like calculate approximations of pi, but I didn\\'t know enough math to do anything interesting of that type. So I\\'m not surprised I can\\'t remember any programs I wrote, because they can\\'t have done much. My clearest memory is of the moment I learned it was possible for programs not to terminate, when one of mine didn\\'t. On a machine without time-sharing, this was a social as well as a technical error, as the data center manager\\'s expression made clear.\\n\\nWith microcomputers, everything changed.'"

       "\"It felt like I was doing life right. I remember that because I was slightly dismayed at how novel it felt. The good news is that I had more moments like this over the next few years.\\n\\nIn the summer of 2016 we moved to England. We wanted our kids to see what it was like living in another country, and since I was a British citizen by birth, that seemed the obvious choice. We only meant to stay for a year, but we liked it so much that we still live there. So most of Bel was written in England.\\n\\nIn the fall of 2019, Bel was finally finished. Like McCarthy's original Lisp, it's a spec rather than an implementation, although like McCarthy's Lisp it's a spec expressed as code.\\n\\nNow that I could write essays again, I wrote a bunch about topics I'd had stacked up. I kept writing essays through 2020, but I also started to think about other things I could work on. How should I choose what to do? Well, how had I chosen what to work on in the past? I wrote an essay for myself to answer that question, and I was surprised how long and messy the answer turned out to be. If this surprised me, who'd lived it, then I thought perhaps it would be interesting to other people, and encouraging to those with similarly messy lives. So I wrote a more detailed version for others to read, and this is the last sentence of it.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNotes\\n\\n[1] My experience skipped a step in the evolution of computers: time-sharing machines with interactive OSes. I went straight from batch processing to microcomputers, which made microcomputers seem all the more exciting.\\n\\n[2] Italian words for abstract concepts can nearly always be predicted from their English cognates (except for occasional traps like polluzione). It's the everyday words that differ. So if you string together a lot of abstract concepts with a few simple verbs, you can make a little Italian go a long way.\\n\\n[3] I lived at Piazza San Felice 4, so my walk to the Accademia went straight down the spine of old Florence: past the Pitti, across the bridge, past Orsanmichele, between the Duomo and the Baptistery, and then up Via Ricasoli to Piazza San Marco.\""

      "Question: What were the two main things the author worked on before college?\n",
      "Answer: The author worked on writing and programming before college.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What were the limitations of the 1401 computer and why couldn't the author do much with it?\n",
      "Answer: The author mentions that the 1401 computer had limitations in terms of input. The only form of input to programs was data stored on punched cards, and the author did not have any data stored on punched cards. Additionally, the author did not know enough math to do anything interesting that did not rely on input. Therefore, the author couldn't do much with the 1401 computer due to these limitations.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What was the author's first experience with computers and programming?\n",
      "Answer: The author's first experience with computers and programming was in 9th grade when they had access to an IBM 1401 computer in the basement of their junior high school. They used an early version of Fortran and had to type programs on punch cards. However, they were puzzled by the 1401 and didn't know what to do with it, as they didn't have any data stored on punched cards. They couldn't remember any specific programs they wrote, but they do remember the moment they learned that programs could fail to terminate.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What were the two things that inspired the author to work on AI?\n",
      "Answer: The two things that inspired the author to work on AI were a novel by Heinlein called The Moon is a Harsh Mistress, which featured an intelligent computer called Mike, and a PBS documentary that showed Terry Winograd using SHRDLU.\n",

      "\n",
      "Question: What realization did the author have during their first year of grad school regarding AI?\n",
      "Answer: The author realized that the way AI was being practiced at the time, with programs translating natural language into formal representations, was not effective in actually understanding natural language. They recognized that there was an unbridgeable gap between what these programs could do and true understanding of natural language. The author concluded that the approach of using explicit data structures to represent concepts in AI was not going to work.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What motivated the author to write a book about Lisp hacking?\n",
      "Answer: The author was motivated to write a book about Lisp hacking because they wanted to learn more about it. They believed that writing a book about something would help them learn it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What realization did the author have while visiting the Carnegie Institute?\n",
      "Answer: The author realized that paintings were something that could be created and would last, unlike the systems work they had been doing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What was the author's initial perception of people who made art?\n",
      "Answer: The author initially perceived people who made art as either living long ago or being mysterious geniuses doing strange things in profiles in Life magazine. The idea of actually being able to make art seemed almost miraculous to the author.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What was the author's initial plan for their dissertation topic?\n",

      "\n",
      "Question: What is the difference between painting still lives and painting people?\n",
      "Answer: Painting still lives and painting people differ in terms of the subject's ability to move. Still lives, as the name suggests, are objects that cannot move, allowing the artist to closely observe and potentially copy them pixel by pixel. On the other hand, people can only sit for a limited amount of time and tend to move, making it necessary for the artist to have a generic understanding of how to paint a person and then modify it to match the specific individual being painted.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What is the purpose of low-level processes in visual perception?\n",
      "Answer: The purpose of low-level processes in visual perception is to identify and categorize objects or elements in the environment without providing detailed information about their specific characteristics or attributes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What was the main difference between Interleaf's software and Microsoft Word?\n",

      "\n",
      "Question: What did the author learn about technology companies while working at Interleaf?\n",
      "Answer: The author learned several things about technology companies while working at Interleaf. They learned that it is better for technology companies to be run by product people rather than sales people. They also learned that it leads to bugs when code is edited by too many people, and that cheap office space is not worth it if it is depressing. Additionally, the author learned that planned meetings are inferior to corridor conversations, that big bureaucratic customers can be a dangerous source of money, and that there is not much overlap between conventional office hours and the optimal time for hacking.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: According to the author, why is it advantageous to be the 'entry level' option?\n",
      "Answer: Being the 'entry level' option is advantageous because if you're not, someone else will be, and they will surpass you and limit your growth. Additionally, being the 'entry level' option allows you to cater to a wider audience and capture a larger market share.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What is the purpose of a signature style in painting?\n",
      "Answer: The purpose of a signature style in painting is to create a visual identity that immediately distinguishes the work as belonging to a specific artist. It serves as a way for artists to express themselves and make their work easily recognizable and unique. Additionally, having a signature style can increase the value and desirability of the artwork, as buyers are often willing to pay more for pieces that have a distinctive and recognizable style.\n",

      "\n",
      "Question: What was the initial plan for building online stores in the summer of 1995?\n",
      "Answer: The initial plan for building online stores in the summer of 1995 was to develop normal desktop software, specifically Windows software. However, the individuals involved in the project were not familiar with writing Windows software and preferred to work in the Unix world. As a result, they decided to create a prototype store builder on Unix instead.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What is a web app and why was it considered groundbreaking at the time?\n",
      "Answer: A web app is a type of software that can be accessed and used through a web browser, without the need for any additional client software or command line input. It was considered groundbreaking at the time because it was not clear if it was even possible to build a whole store or application through a browser without the need for traditional software installation or server-side command line input. The ability to control and update software directly on the server, without the need for versions or ports, was seen as a significant advancement in software development.\n",

      "\n",
      "Question: What is the significance of 'doing things that don't scale' in the context of the startup?\n",
      "Answer: The significance of 'doing things that don't scale' in the context of the startup is that it helped the startup gain users and grow. Although it may have seemed humiliating to build stores for users when the software was designed for users to make their own stores, it was a desperate measure to attract users. This approach taught the startup about retail and how it felt to use their software, which ultimately contributed to their growth. It highlights the importance of prioritizing user acquisition and satisfaction, even if it means taking unconventional or non-scalable actions.\n",

      "\n",
      "Question: Why did the author leave Yahoo after their options vested?\n",
      "Answer: The author left Yahoo after their options vested because they had originally joined the company with the goal of getting rich so they could pursue their passion for painting. Now that they had become rich, they decided it was time to leave and focus on their artistic pursuits.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: Why did the author advise founders who sell their companies to take a vacation?\n",
      "Answer: The author advises founders who sell their companies to take a vacation because the author regrets not taking a break after leaving Yahoo to pursue painting.

      "\n",
      "Question: What is the significance of Lisp in the author's writing and how does it compare to Latin?\n",
      "Answer: The author finds Lisp significant because of its origins as a model of computation and its power and elegance as a programming language. The author was attracted to Lisp in college, although they didn't fully understand why at the time. Lisp's core is a language defined by writing an interpreter in itself, which sets it apart from other programming languages. In contrast, Latin is not mentioned in the given context, so there is no comparison made between Lisp and Latin.\n",

      "Question: Who were some of the notable individuals in the first batch of the Summer Founders Program?\n",
      "Answer: Some of the notable individuals in the first batch of the Summer Founders Program were reddit, Justin Kan and Emmett Shear (who went on to found Twitch), Aaron Swartz (who had already helped write the RSS spec and would later become a martyr for open access), and Sam Altman (who would later become the second president of YC).\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What are some advantages of scale that YC noticed as it grew?\n",
      "Answer: YC noticed several advantages of scale as it grew. One advantage was that the alumni became a tight community dedicated to helping one another, especially the current batch. Another advantage was that the startups in the program started to become each other's customers. YC also observed that many startups were able to get their initial set of customers from among their batchmates.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: Why did the author change the name of the platform to Hacker News?\n",
      "Answer: The author changed the name of the platform to Hacker News because they wanted to reach future startup founders, not just current startup founders. They believed that the name \"Hacker News\" would be more appealing and engaging to those who had an intellectual curiosity, rather than solely focusing on startups.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What made YC different from other kinds of work the author had done?\n",
      "Answer: The problems in YC came to the author instead of the author deciding what to work on.\n",
      "\n",

      "Answer: Rtm offered unsolicited advice to the author because he wanted to make sure that Y Combinator wasn't the last cool thing the author did.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: Why did the founders of YC decide to recruit Sam Altman as the new president?\n",
      "Answer: The founders of YC decided to recruit Sam Altman as the new president because they wanted YC to last for a long time and believed that it couldn't be controlled by the founders. They wanted to make a complete changing of the guard and allow Sam Altman to reorganize YC. Initially, Sam Altman said no to the offer as he wanted to start a startup to make nuclear reactors, but after persistent persuasion, he finally agreed in October 2013.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What did the author decide to do after stopping work on YC?\n",
      "Answer: After stopping work on YC, the author decided to start painting. They wanted to see how good they could get at painting if they really focused on it. They spent most of the rest of 2014 painting, and although they got better, they felt they were not good enough. However, in November, they ran out of steam and stopped working on their painting.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What is the distinctive feature of Lisp that sets it apart from other programming languages?\n",
      "Answer: Lisp is distinctive because its core is a language defined by writing an interpreter in itself. It was originally intended as a formal model of computation, rather than a traditional programming language. This unique feature gives Lisp a power and elegance that other languages cannot match.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What was the reason why McCarthy's original axiomatic approach couldn't be used to define the added features?\n",
      "Answer: The reason why McCarthy's original axiomatic approach couldn't be used to define the added features is because it wouldn't have been feasible at the time. McCarthy tested his interpreter by hand-simulating the execution of programs, but as the interpreters became more complicated, it would have been necessary to run them on computers. However, computers at that time were not powerful enough to handle the more complex interpreters.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What challenges did the author face while working on Bel?\n",
      "Answer: The author faced challenges while working on Bel, particularly in keeping track of what was happening at different levels and deciphering errors that could become difficult to understand.

      "Question: What was the author's experience with computers like, and how did it shape their perception of microcomputers?\n",
      "Answer: The author's experience with computers was initially limited to using a 1401, which was not very useful due to the lack of input options. They couldn't do much with it and didn't remember any significant programs they wrote. However, when microcomputers became available, the author's perception changed. They were impressed and envious of their friend who built a microcomputer from a kit. This experience sparked their interest in programming, and they convinced their father to buy a TRS-80. This marked the beginning of their programming journey, during which they wrote simple games, a program to predict rocket heights, and even a word processor. The author's experience with microcomputers shaped their perception by showing them the potential of having a computer right in front of them, responding to their keystrokes in real-time, which was a significant improvement over the limitations of the 1401.\n",

      "Question: Why is it beneficial for the brain to not notice every detail in everyday life?\n",
      "Answer: Noticing every detail in everyday life would be distracting. The brain handles most visual perception through low-level processes that only provide basic information, such as identifying objects without specifying details like the shape and position of every leaf on a bush or the lightest and darkest points on a water droplet. This is a feature of the brain, not a bug, as it allows us to focus on what is important and not get overwhelmed by the sheer amount of visual information.\n",

      "Question: How did Lisp evolve from being a formal model of computation to a programming language?\n",
      "Answer: Lisp evolved from being a formal model of computation to a programming language when John McCarthy's grad student, Steve Russell, suggested that McCarthy's Lisp interpreter could be used to program computers. Russell translated McCarthy's interpreter into IBM 704 machine language, and from that point, Lisp started to be used as a programming language in the ordinary sense. McCarthy's original Lisp interpreter was then expanded to include additional features that were necessary for a programming language.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: Why was it difficult to test a more complicated interpreter using McCarthy's original approach?\n",
      "Answer: Testing a more complicated interpreter using McCarthy's original approach was difficult because computers at that time were not powerful enough. McCarthy had to hand-simulate the execution of programs to test his interpreter, but as the complexity of the interpreter increased, it became impractical to test it in this way. To test a more complicated interpreter, it would have been necessary to run it on a computer, but the computers of that era did not have enough power to handle such complex programs.\n",

      "Question: What is the difference between rent-controlled and rent-stabilized apartments, and why is it significant in the context of the passage?\n",
      "Answer: Rent-controlled and rent-stabilized apartments are different in terms of the regulations that govern their rent prices. Rent-controlled apartments have strict regulations on rent increases and are typically occupied by long-term tenants. On the other hand, rent-stabilized apartments have more flexible regulations, allowing for gradual rent increases over time. \n",
      "\n",
      "In the context of the passage, the significance lies in the fact that the apartment being referred to is described as \"really cheap, less than half market price.\" This suggests that the apartment is either rent-controlled or rent-stabilized, which explains why it is significantly cheaper compared to the market price.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What is the significance of treating the online version as the primary version when publishing online?\n",
      "Answer: Treating the online version as the primary version when publishing online is significant because it allows for a wider audience reach. In the print era, there was a limited channel for publishing essays, and only a select few were allowed to publish essays. By publishing online, anyone can read the essays, and there are no gatekeepers like editors or publishers. This opens up the opportunity for more essays to be written and published, as there is no longer a barrier to entry. Additionally, publishing online allows for immediate access to the content, as opposed to waiting for a book or magazine to be published. Overall, treating the online version as the primary version democratizes the publishing process and enables a broader dissemination of ideas.\n",

      "\n",
      "Question: What is the difference between painting still lives and painting people?\n",
      "Answer: Painting still lives and painting people differ in terms of the subject's ability to move. Still lives, as the name suggests, are objects that cannot move, allowing the artist to closely observe and potentially copy them pixel by pixel. On the other hand, people can only sit for a limited amount of time and tend to move, making it necessary for the artist to have a generic understanding of how to paint a person and then modify it to match the specific individual being painted.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What does the author mean by 'emphasizing the visual cues' in a still life painting?\n",
      "Answer: By 'emphasizing the visual cues' in a still life painting, the author means highlighting the details and characteristics that indicate certain aspects of the objects being painted. This could include features like the sudden change in color at the edge of an object, which signifies its boundary. The author suggests that by subtly emphasizing these visual cues, the artist can create paintings that are more realistic than photographs, not just in a metaphorical sense, but in terms of conveying detailed information about the objects being depicted.\n",

It was only later, after realizing that online stores were similar to the sites they had been generating for galleries, that they decided to build an online store builder. The author's background in art did not play a significant role in this decision or in the development of the online store builder.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What was the state of online stores when the business opened in January 1996?\n",
      "Answer: The state of online stores when the business opened in January 1996 was still in its early stages. The concept of building online stores was relatively new, and the founders of the business were trying to develop software to create these stores. They initially planned to create desktop software for Windows, but later decided to build a prototype store builder on Unix.

      "\n",
      "Question: According to the author, what is the significance of being drawn to work that lacks prestige?\n",
      "Answer: Being drawn to work that lacks prestige is significant because it indicates that there is something real to be discovered in that work and that the individual has the right kind of motives. It suggests that the person is not driven by impure motives, such as the desire to impress others. While working on things that aren't prestigious doesn't guarantee that one is on the right track, it at least ensures that they are not on the most common type of wrong one.\n",

      "Answer: The author states that Hacker News (HN) was the biggest source of stress for them. They mention that if all they had to do was select and help founders, life would have been easier. This implies that HN was a mistake and that the biggest source of stress in one's work should be something close to the core of the work. The author compares themselves to someone in pain while running a marathon not from the exertion of running, but because of a blister from an ill-fitting shoe. Therefore, it can be inferred that HN caused a significant amount of stress for the author because it was not directly related to their core work of selecting and helping founders.\n",
