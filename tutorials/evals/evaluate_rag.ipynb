    "\n",
    "LLMs are trained on vast datasets, but these will not include your specific data (things like company knowledge bases and documentation). Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) addresses this by dynamically incorporating your data as context during the generation process. This is done not by altering the training data of the LLMs but by allowing the model to access and utilize your data in real-time to provide more tailored and contextually relevant responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "In RAG, your data is loaded and prepared for queries. This process is called indexing. User queries act on this index, which filters your data down to the most relevant context. This context and your query then are sent to the LLM along with a prompt, and the LLM provides a response.\n",
    "\n",
    "RAG is a critical component for building applications such a chatbots or agents and you will want to know RAG techniques on how to get data into your application.\n",

    "## Stages within RAG\n",
    "\n",
    "There are five key stages within RAG, which will in turn be a part of any larger RAG application.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Loading**: This refers to getting your data from where it lives - whether it's text files, PDFs, another website, a database or an API - into your pipeline.\n",
    "- **Indexing**: This means creating a data structure that allows for querying the data. For LLMs this nearly always means creating vector embeddings, numerical representations of the meaning of your data, as well as numerous other metadata strategies to make it easy to accurately find contextually relevant data.\n",
    "- **Storing**: Once your data is indexed, you will want to store your index, along with any other metadata, to avoid the need to re-index it.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Querying**: For any given indexing strategy there are many ways you can utilize LLMs and data structures to query, including sub-queries, multi-step queries, and hybrid strategies. \n",
    "- **Evaluation**: A critical step in any pipeline is checking how effective it is relative to other strategies, or when you make changes. Evaluation provides objective measures on how accurate, faithful, and fast your responses to queries are.\n"

       "'What I Worked On\\n\\nFebruary 2021\\n\\nBefore college the two main things I worked on, outside of school, were writing and programming. I didn\\'t write essays. I wrote what beginning writers were supposed to write then, and probably still are: short stories. My stories were awful. They had hardly any plot, just characters with strong feelings, which I imagined made them deep.\\n\\nThe first programs I tried writing were on the IBM 1401 that our school district used for what was then called \"data processing.\" This was in 9th grade, so I was 13 or 14. The school district\\'s 1401 happened to be in the basement of our junior high school, and my friend Rich Draves and I got permission to use it. It was like a mini Bond villain\\'s lair down there, with all these alien-looking machines ‚Äî CPU, disk drives, printer, card reader ‚Äî sitting up on a raised floor under bright fluorescent lights.\\n\\nThe language we used was an early version of Fortran. You had to type programs on punch cards, then stack them in the card reader and press a button to load the program into memory and run it. The result would ordinarily be to print something on the spectacularly loud printer.\\n\\nI was puzzled by the 1401. I couldn\\'t figure out what to do with it. And in retrospect there\\'s not much I could have done with it. The only form of input to programs was data stored on punched cards, and I didn\\'t have any data stored on punched cards. The only other option was to do things that didn\\'t rely on any input, like calculate approximations of pi, but I didn\\'t know enough math to do anything interesting of that type. So I\\'m not surprised I can\\'t remember any programs I wrote, because they can\\'t have done much. My clearest memory is of the moment I learned it was possible for programs not to terminate, when one of mine didn\\'t. On a machine without time-sharing, this was a social as well as a technical error, as the data center manager\\'s expression made clear.\\n\\nWith microcomputers, everything changed.'"

       "\"It felt like I was doing life right. I remember that because I was slightly dismayed at how novel it felt. The good news is that I had more moments like this over the next few years.\\n\\nIn the summer of 2016 we moved to England. We wanted our kids to see what it was like living in another country, and since I was a British citizen by birth, that seemed the obvious choice. We only meant to stay for a year, but we liked it so much that we still live there. So most of Bel was written in England.\\n\\nIn the fall of 2019, Bel was finally finished. Like McCarthy's original Lisp, it's a spec rather than an implementation, although like McCarthy's Lisp it's a spec expressed as code.\\n\\nNow that I could write essays again, I wrote a bunch about topics I'd had stacked up. I kept writing essays through 2020, but I also started to think about other things I could work on. How should I choose what to do? Well, how had I chosen what to work on in the past? I wrote an essay for myself to answer that question, and I was surprised how long and messy the answer turned out to be. If this surprised me, who'd lived it, then I thought perhaps it would be interesting to other people, and encouraging to those with similarly messy lives. So I wrote a more detailed version for others to read, and this is the last sentence of it.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNotes\\n\\n[1] My experience skipped a step in the evolution of computers: time-sharing machines with interactive OSes. I went straight from batch processing to microcomputers, which made microcomputers seem all the more exciting.\\n\\n[2] Italian words for abstract concepts can nearly always be predicted from their English cognates (except for occasional traps like polluzione). It's the everyday words that differ. So if you string together a lot of abstract concepts with a few simple verbs, you can make a little Italian go a long way.\\n\\n[3] I lived at Piazza San Felice 4, so my walk to the Accademia went straight down the spine of old Florence: past the Pitti, across the bridge, past Orsanmichele, between the Duomo and the Baptistery, and then up Via Ricasoli to Piazza San Marco.\""

      "Question: What were the two main things the author worked on before college?\n",
      "Answer: Before college, the author worked on writing and programming.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What were the limitations of the 1401 computer and why couldn't the author do much with it?\n",
      "Answer: The author mentions that the 1401 computer had limitations in terms of input. The only form of input to programs was data stored on punched cards, and the author did not have any data stored on punched cards. Additionally, the author did not know enough math to do anything interesting that did not rely on input. Therefore, the author couldn't do much with the 1401 computer due to these limitations.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What was the author's first experience with computers and programming?\n",
      "Answer: The author's first experience with computers and programming was in 9th grade when they had access to an IBM 1401 computer in the basement of their junior high school. They used an early version of Fortran and had to type programs on punch cards. However, they were puzzled by the 1401 and couldn't figure out what to do with it. They didn't have any data stored on punched cards and didn't know enough math to do anything interesting. Their clearest memory from that time was when they learned that it was possible for programs not to terminate.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What were the two things that inspired the author to work on AI?\n",
      "Answer: The two things that inspired the author to work on AI were a novel by Heinlein called The Moon is a Harsh Mistress, which featured an intelligent computer called Mike, and a PBS documentary that showed Terry Winograd using SHRDLU.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What was the author's undergraduate thesis about?\n",
      "Answer: The context does not provide any information about the author's undergraduate thesis.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What realization did the author have during their first year of grad school regarding AI?\n",
      "Answer: The author realized that the type of AI being practiced at the time, which involved translating natural language into formal representations and adding them to a list of known things, was not capable of truly understanding natural language. They recognized that there was an unbridgeable gap between what these programs could do and actual comprehension of natural language. The author concluded that the approach of using explicit data structures to represent concepts in AI was not going to be successful.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What motivated the author to write a book about Lisp hacking?\n",
      "Answer: The author was motivated to write a book about Lisp hacking because writing a book about something helps in learning it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What realization did the author have while visiting the Carnegie Institute?\n",
      "Answer: The author realized that paintings were something that could be made and would last, unlike the systems work they had been doing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What was the author's initial perception of people who made art?\n",
      "Answer: The author initially perceived people who made art as either living long ago or being mysterious geniuses doing strange things in profiles in Life magazine. The idea of actually being able to make art seemed almost miraculous to the author.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What was the author's initial plan for their dissertation topic?\n",
      "Answer: The author's initial plan for their dissertation topic was to write about applications of continuations.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What is the purpose of the foundation classes that the author had to take at RISD?\n",
      "Answer: The purpose of the foundation classes at RISD is to provide fundamental instruction in subjects like drawing, color, and design.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What arrangement had the students and faculty in the painting department at the Accademia arrived at?\n",
      "Answer: The students and faculty in the painting department at the Accademia had arrived at an arrangement where the students wouldn't require the faculty to teach anything, and in return the faculty wouldn't require the students to learn anything.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What is the difference between painting still lives and painting people?\n",
      "Answer: Painting still lives and painting people differ in terms of the subject's ability to move. Still lives, as the name suggests, are objects that cannot move, allowing the artist to closely observe and potentially copy them pixel by pixel. On the other hand, people can only sit for a limited amount of time and tend to move, making it necessary for the artist to have a generic understanding of how to paint a person and then modify it to match the specific individual being painted.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What is the purpose of low-level processes in visual perception?\n",
      "Answer: The purpose of low-level processes in visual perception is to identify and categorize objects or elements in the environment without providing detailed information about their specific characteristics or attributes. These processes serve to filter out unnecessary details and allow the brain to focus on more relevant information for everyday functioning.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What was the main difference between Interleaf's software and Microsoft Word?\n",
      "Answer: The main difference between Interleaf's software and Microsoft Word was that Interleaf's software had a scripting language, inspired by Emacs and based on Lisp, while Microsoft Word did not have this feature.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What did the author learn about technology companies while working at Interleaf?\n",
      "Answer: The author learned several things about technology companies while working at Interleaf. They learned that it is better for technology companies to be run by product people rather than sales people, that editing code by too many people can lead to bugs, that cheap office space can be depressing, that planned meetings are inferior to corridor conversations, that big bureaucratic customers can be a dangerous source of money, and that there is not much overlap between conventional office hours and the optimal time for hacking. Additionally, the author learned that the low end tends to eat the high end in technology, and that it is better to be the \"entry level\" option rather than aiming for prestige.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: According to the author, why is it advantageous to be the 'entry level' option?\n",
      "Answer: Being the 'entry level' option is advantageous because if you're not, someone else will be, and they will surpass you and limit your growth. Additionally, being the 'entry level' option allows you to cater to a wider audience and capture a larger market share.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What is the purpose of a signature style in painting?\n",
      "Answer: The purpose of a signature style in painting is to create a visual identity that immediately distinguishes the work as belonging to a specific artist. It serves as a way for artists to express themselves and make their work easily recognizable and unique. Additionally, having a signature style can increase the value and desirability of the artwork, as buyers are often willing to pay more for pieces that have a distinctive and recognizable style.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What motivated the author to drop out of RISD in 1993?\n",
      "Answer: The context information does not provide any information about the author dropping out of RISD in 1993.\n",

      "\n",
      "Question: What was the initial startup idea of the author and why did it fail?\n",
      "Answer: The initial startup idea of the author was to start an investment firm with his friend Jessica and two other partners. They wanted to implement ideas they had been discussing, such as making a larger number of smaller investments, funding younger and more technical founders, and allowing the founders to remain as CEO. However, it is not mentioned in the given context why this startup idea failed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What was the initial plan for building online stores in the summer of 1995?\n",
      "Answer: The initial plan for building online stores in the summer of 1995 was to write software for normal desktop software, specifically for Windows. However, neither of the individuals involved knew how to write Windows software or wanted to learn. They decided to write a prototype store builder on Unix instead.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What is a web app and why was it considered groundbreaking at the time?\n",
      "Answer: A web app is a type of software that can be accessed and used through a web browser without the need for any additional client software or command line input. It was considered groundbreaking at the time because it demonstrated that it was possible to build and control a whole store through a browser, without the need for traditional client-server software or manual input on the server. This meant that users could access and use the software directly through their browsers, eliminating the need for complex installations or updates. This approach was seen as a new generation of software that simplified the user experience and made it easier to update and maintain the software on the server side.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What was the significance of the deal mentioned in the context information for Y Combinator?\n",
      "Answer: The deal mentioned in the context information for Y Combinator was significant because it provided funding for startups in return for a percentage of equity. This deal allowed Y Combinator to scale startup funding by investing in batches of startups, which was more convenient for Y Combinator and provided a supportive community for the founders. Additionally, the deal helped solve the problem of isolation faced by founders and allowed startups to become each other's customers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: Who did Robert recommend as a programmer to recruit?\n",
      "Answer: Robert recommended Trevor Blackwell as a programmer to recruit.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What were the three main parts of the software mentioned in the context?\n",
      "Answer: The three main parts of the software mentioned in the context were the editor, the shopping cart, and the manager.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What is the significance of 'doing things that don't scale' in the context of the startup?\n",
      "Answer: The significance of 'doing things that don't scale' in the context of the startup is that it helped the startup to acquire users and grow, even though those actions may not have been efficient or sustainable in the long term. By being willing to take desperate measures, such as building stores for users, the startup was able to attract users and learn valuable lessons about retail and user experience. This approach prioritized user acquisition and satisfaction over scalability, recognizing that growth rate is the ultimate test of a startup.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What is the ultimate test of a startup's success according to the author?\n",
      "Answer: The ultimate test of a startup's success, according to the author, is its growth rate.\n",

      "Question: Why did the author feel relieved when Yahoo bought their company?\n",
      "Answer: The author felt relieved when Yahoo bought their company because it provided a sense of financial security. The author mentions that their Viaweb stock was valuable in principle, but they were not sure how to value a business. Additionally, the author was constantly aware of the near-death experiences the company faced and had not significantly changed their lifestyle since starting the company. Therefore, when Yahoo bought the company, it felt like going from a state of financial uncertainty to a state of wealth and stability.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: Why did the author leave Yahoo after their options vested?\n",
      "Answer: The author left Yahoo after their options vested because they had originally joined the company with the goal of getting rich so they could pursue their passion for painting. Now that they had become rich, they decided it was time to leave and focus on their artistic pursuits.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: Why did the author advise founders who sell their companies to take a vacation?\n",
      "Answer: The author advises founders who sell their companies to take a vacation because they believe it is important to take a break and relax after such a significant event.\n",

      "Answer: In the print era, the channel for publishing essays was vanishingly small. Only a few officially anointed thinkers who went to the right parties in New York and specialists writing about their specialties were allowed to publish essays. This limited access meant that many essays that could have been written were never published due to the lack of a platform.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What is the significance of Lisp in the author's writing and how does it compare to Latin?\n",
      "Answer: The author finds Lisp significant because of its origins as a model of computation and its power and elegance as a programming language. The author was attracted to Lisp in college, although they didn't fully understand why at the time. Lisp's core is a language defined by writing an interpreter in itself, which sets it apart from other programming languages. In contrast, Latin is not mentioned in the given context, so it is not possible to compare Lisp to Latin based on the provided information.\n",
      "\n",

      "Answer: Julian helped the author and their team in setting up their company by getting them incorporated, with bylaws and stock and all the necessary paperwork.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What was the purpose of organizing a summer program for undergrads to start startups?\n",
      "Answer: The purpose of organizing a summer program for undergrads to start startups was to provide them with a more interesting summer experience than working at companies like Microsoft. Additionally, it allowed the organizers to practice being investors and gain experience in the field.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: Who were some of the notable individuals in the first batch of the Summer Founders Program?\n",
      "Answer: Some of the notable individuals in the first batch of the Summer Founders Program were reddit, Justin Kan and Emmett Shear (who went on to found Twitch), Aaron Swartz (who had already helped write the RSS spec and would later become a martyr for open access), and Sam Altman (who would later become the second president of YC).\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What are some advantages of scale that YC noticed as it grew?\n",
      "Answer: YC noticed several advantages of scale as it grew. One advantage was that the alumni became a tight community, dedicated to helping one another and especially the current batch. Another advantage was that the startups in the program were becoming each other's customers. YC also noticed that many startups were getting their initial set of customers almost entirely from among their batchmates.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: Why did the author change the name of the platform to Hacker News?\n",
      "Answer: The author changed the name of the platform to Hacker News because they wanted to reach future startup founders, not just current startup founders. They believed that the name \"Hacker News\" would be more appealing and engaging to those who had an intellectual curiosity, rather than focusing solely on startups.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What made YC different from other kinds of work the author had done?\n",
      "Answer: The problems came to the author instead of the author deciding what to work on. Every 6 months, there was a new batch of startups with their own problems, which became the author's problems. This made the work engaging and allowed the author to learn a lot about startups in a short amount of time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: Why did Rtm offer unsolicited advice to the author?\n",
      "Answer: Rtm offered unsolicited advice to the author because he wanted to make sure that Y Combinator wasn't the last cool thing the author did.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: Why did the founders of YC decide to recruit Sam Altman as the new president?\n",
      "Answer: The founders of YC decided to recruit Sam Altman as the new president because they wanted YC to last for a long time and believed that it couldn't be controlled by the founders. They wanted to make a complete changing of the guard and allow Sam Altman to reorganize YC. Initially, Sam Altman said no to the offer as he wanted to start a startup to make nuclear reactors, but after persistent persuasion, he finally agreed in October 2013.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What did the author decide to do after stopping work on YC?\n",
      "Answer: After stopping work on YC, the author decided to start painting. They wanted to see how good they could get at painting if they really focused on it. They spent most of the rest of 2014 painting and were able to improve their skills. However, in November, they ran out of steam and stopped working on a painting. After that, they started writing essays again and eventually started working on Lisp.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What is the distinctive feature of Lisp that sets it apart from other programming languages?\n",
      "Answer: Lisp is distinctive because its core is a language defined by writing an interpreter in itself. It was originally intended as a formal model of computation, rather than a programming language in the ordinary sense. This unique feature gives Lisp a power and elegance that other languages cannot match.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What was the reason why McCarthy's original axiomatic approach couldn't be used to define the added features?\n",
      "Answer: The reason why McCarthy's original axiomatic approach couldn't be used to define the added features is because it wouldn't have been feasible at the time. McCarthy tested his interpreter by hand-simulating the execution of programs, but as the interpreter became more complicated, it would have required running it on computers that weren't powerful enough at that time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What challenges did the author face while working on Bel?\n",
      "Answer: The author faced challenges while working on Bel, particularly in understanding the code due to the complexity of the problem. Working on an interpreter written in itself made it difficult to keep track of what was happening at different levels, and errors could become difficult to decipher. Additionally, the author mentioned wrestling with gruesome bugs for hours, indicating the presence of technical challenges during the development process.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What was the reason for the author's move to England in the summer of 2016?\n",

      "Question: What was the author's experience with computers like, and how did it shape their perception of microcomputers?\n",
      "Answer: The author's experience with computers was initially limited due to the high cost and limited accessibility of computers in those days. It took the author years of convincing before their father finally bought a TRS-80 computer in 1980. Despite not having the top-of-the-line Apple II, the author found the TRS-80 to be good enough and started programming on it. They wrote simple games, a program to predict rocket heights, and even a word processor for their father. The author's experience with computers shaped their perception of microcomputers as a significant improvement. With microcomputers, they could have a computer right in front of them, responding to their keystrokes in real-time, instead of relying on punch cards and waiting for results. This newfound accessibility and interactivity made microcomputers much more appealing and exciting to the author.\n",

It aims to understand the fundamental principles and theoretical underpinnings of computing. On the other hand, systems work is more practical and hands-on. It involves designing, implementing, and optimizing software and hardware systems. Systems work is concerned with building real-world applications and technologies that can be used by people. While theory is often seen as more admirable, systems work is considered more exciting because it involves creating tangible and functional products. However, one drawback of systems work is that the programs and technologies developed may become obsolete over time.\n",

      "\n",
      "Question: Why is it beneficial for the brain to not notice every detail in everyday life?\n",
      "Answer: Noticing every detail in everyday life would be distracting. The brain handles most visual perception through low-level processes that only provide basic information, such as identifying objects without specifying details like the shape and position of every leaf on a bush or the lightest and darkest points on a water droplet. This is a feature of the brain, not a bug, as it allows us to focus on what is important and not get overwhelmed by the abundance of details in our surroundings.\n",

      "Answer: The author found it encouraging that online essays would initially seem like rants posted by nutjobs because it meant that the online medium was not yet prestigious. The author believes that working on things that aren't prestigious can be a sign that there is something real to be discovered and that one has the right kind of motives. The desire to impress people can lead to impure motives, so the author sees the lack of prestige as a way to avoid this common trap.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: Why does the author believe that being drawn to work that lacks prestige can be a sign of something valuable?\n",
      "Answer: Being drawn to work that lacks prestige can be a sign of something valuable because it indicates that there is something real to be discovered in that field and that the individual has the right kind of motives. The author suggests that working on things that aren't prestigious doesn't guarantee being on the right track, but it at least ensures that one is not on the most common type of wrong track. The desire to impress people and seek prestige can lead to impure motives, which can be a danger for the ambitious. Therefore, being drawn to unprestigious work can be a positive sign as it suggests a genuine interest in exploring new ideas and possibilities.\n",

      "Question: How did Lisp evolve from being a formal model of computation to a programming language?\n",
      "Answer: Lisp evolved from being a formal model of computation to a programming language when John McCarthy's grad student, Steve Russell, suggested that McCarthy's Lisp interpreter could be used to program computers. Russell then translated McCarthy's interpreter into IBM 704 machine language, which allowed Lisp to be used as a programming language in the ordinary sense. McCarthy's original Lisp interpreter was missing many features that are typically found in programming languages, so these had to be added over time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: Why was it difficult to test a more complicated interpreter using McCarthy's original approach?\n",
      "Answer: Testing a more complicated interpreter using McCarthy's original approach was difficult because computers at that time were not powerful enough. McCarthy had to hand-simulate the execution of programs to test his interpreter, but as the complexity of the interpreter increased, it became impractical to test it in this way. To test a more complicated interpreter, it would have been necessary to run it on a computer, but the computers of that era did not have enough power to handle such complex programs.\n",
      "\n",

      "Question: What is the relationship between Italian and English words in terms of abstract concepts and everyday words?\n",
      "Answer: Italian words for abstract concepts can nearly always be predicted from their English cognates, except for occasional traps. However, it's the everyday words that differ between Italian and English. So, if you string together a lot of abstract concepts with a few simple verbs, you can make a little Italian go a long way.\n",

      "Question: What is the difference between rent-controlled and rent-stabilized apartments, and why is it significant in the context of the passage?\n",
      "Answer: Rent-controlled apartments and rent-stabilized apartments are two different types of housing regulations. Rent-controlled apartments typically have stricter regulations on rent increases and tenant protections. These regulations are usually in place for older buildings and are intended to provide long-term affordable housing options. Rent-stabilized apartments, on the other hand, have more flexible regulations and allow for gradual rent increases over time. \n",
      "\n",
      "In the context of the passage, the significance of distinguishing between rent-controlled and rent-stabilized apartments is that the author is emphasizing the affordability of the apartment they lived in.

      "Question: What is the significance of treating the online version as the primary version when publishing online?\n",
      "Answer: Treating the online version as the primary version when publishing online is significant because it allows for a wider audience reach. In the print era, there was a limited channel for publishing essays, and only a select few specialists were allowed to publish their work. By publishing online, anyone can access and read the essays, breaking down the barriers of traditional publishing. This opens up the opportunity for more essays to be written and shared, as there is no longer a need to go through editors or traditional publishing channels. Treating the online version as the primary version also acknowledges the changing landscape of media consumption, where online platforms have become a prominent medium for sharing and accessing information.\n",

      "Question: Why did the founder choose orange as the color for Y Combinator?\n",
      "Answer: The founder chose orange as the color for Y Combinator partly because it is the warmest color and partly because no venture capitalist (VC) used it. In 2005, most VCs used colors like maroon, navy blue, and forest green to appeal to limited partners (LPs), not founders.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What problem arises when running a forum and writing essays simultaneously?\n",
      "Answer: Running a forum and writing essays simultaneously can be challenging because it requires dividing one's time and attention between two different tasks. This can lead to a lack of focus and potentially result in a decrease in the quality or quantity of both forum management and essay writing. Additionally, managing a forum involves engaging with the community, moderating discussions, and addressing any issues that may arise, which can be time-consuming and distract from the writing process. Conversely, writing essays requires concentration, research, and reflection, which may be difficult to achieve while also managing a forum. Therefore, balancing these two activities can be a problem for individuals trying to do both simultaneously.\n",

      "\n",
      "Question: What is the difference between painting still lives and painting people?\n",
      "Answer: Painting still lives and painting people differ in terms of the subject's ability to move. Still lives, as the name suggests, are objects that cannot move, allowing the artist to closely observe and potentially copy them pixel by pixel. On the other hand, people can only sit for a limited amount of time and tend to move, making it necessary for the artist to have a generic understanding of how to paint a person and then modify it to match the specific individual being painted.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What does the author mean by 'emphasizing the visual cues' in a still life painting?\n",
      "Answer: By 'emphasizing the visual cues' in a still life painting, the author means highlighting the details and characteristics that indicate certain aspects of the objects being painted. This could include features like the sudden change in color at the edge of an object, which signifies its boundary. The author suggests that by subtly emphasizing these visual cues, the artist can create paintings that are more realistic than photographs, not just in a metaphorical sense, but in terms of conveying information accurately.\n",

      "Question: In the context of art school, what is a 'signature style' and why do buyers pay a lot for such work?\n",
      "Answer: A 'signature style' in the context of art school refers to a visual style that immediately identifies the work as belonging to a specific artist and sets it apart from the work of others. It is similar to a \"schtick\" in show business. Buyers often pay a lot for artwork with a signature style because it is unique and easily recognizable as the work of a particular artist. This uniqueness and recognition add value to the artwork, making it desirable and worth a higher price.\n",

The author compares themselves to someone in pain while running a marathon not from the exertion of running, but because of a blister from an ill-fitting shoe. Therefore, it can be inferred that HN caused a significant amount of stress for the author because it was not directly related to their core work of selecting and helping founders.\n",
