    "\n",
    "LLMs are trained on vast datasets, but these will not include your specific data (things like company knowledge bases and documentation). Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) addresses this by dynamically incorporating your data as context during the generation process. This is done not by altering the training data of the LLMs but by allowing the model to access and utilize your data in real-time to provide more tailored and contextually relevant responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "In RAG, your data is loaded and prepared for queries. This process is called indexing. User queries act on this index, which filters your data down to the most relevant context. This context and your query then are sent to the LLM along with a prompt, and the LLM provides a response.\n",
    "\n",
    "RAG is a critical component for building applications such a chatbots or agents and you will want to know RAG techniques on how to get data into your application.\n",

    "## Stages within RAG\n",
    "\n",
    "There are five key stages within RAG, which will in turn be a part of any larger RAG application.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Loading**: This refers to getting your data from where it lives - whether it's text files, PDFs, another website, a database or an API - into your pipeline.\n",
    "- **Indexing**: This means creating a data structure that allows for querying the data. For LLMs this nearly always means creating vector embeddings, numerical representations of the meaning of your data, as well as numerous other metadata strategies to make it easy to accurately find contextually relevant data.\n",
    "- **Storing**: Once your data is indexed, you will want to store your index, along with any other metadata, to avoid the need to re-index it.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Querying**: For any given indexing strategy there are many ways you can utilize LLMs and data structures to query, including sub-queries, multi-step queries, and hybrid strategies. \n",
    "- **Evaluation**: A critical step in any pipeline is checking how effective it is relative to other strategies, or when you make changes. Evaluation provides objective measures on how accurate, faithful, and fast your responses to queries are.\n"

       "'What I Worked On\\n\\nFebruary 2021\\n\\nBefore college the two main things I worked on, outside of school, were writing and programming. I didn\\'t write essays. I wrote what beginning writers were supposed to write then, and probably still are: short stories. My stories were awful. They had hardly any plot, just characters with strong feelings, which I imagined made them deep.\\n\\nThe first programs I tried writing were on the IBM 1401 that our school district used for what was then called \"data processing.\" This was in 9th grade, so I was 13 or 14. The school district\\'s 1401 happened to be in the basement of our junior high school, and my friend Rich Draves and I got permission to use it. It was like a mini Bond villain\\'s lair down there, with all these alien-looking machines ‚Äî CPU, disk drives, printer, card reader ‚Äî sitting up on a raised floor under bright fluorescent lights.\\n\\nThe language we used was an early version of Fortran. You had to type programs on punch cards, then stack them in the card reader and press a button to load the program into memory and run it. The result would ordinarily be to print something on the spectacularly loud printer.\\n\\nI was puzzled by the 1401. I couldn\\'t figure out what to do with it. And in retrospect there\\'s not much I could have done with it. The only form of input to programs was data stored on punched cards, and I didn\\'t have any data stored on punched cards. The only other option was to do things that didn\\'t rely on any input, like calculate approximations of pi, but I didn\\'t know enough math to do anything interesting of that type. So I\\'m not surprised I can\\'t remember any programs I wrote, because they can\\'t have done much. My clearest memory is of the moment I learned it was possible for programs not to terminate, when one of mine didn\\'t. On a machine without time-sharing, this was a social as well as a technical error, as the data center manager\\'s expression made clear.\\n\\nWith microcomputers, everything changed.'"

       "\"It felt like I was doing life right. I remember that because I was slightly dismayed at how novel it felt. The good news is that I had more moments like this over the next few years.\\n\\nIn the summer of 2016 we moved to England. We wanted our kids to see what it was like living in another country, and since I was a British citizen by birth, that seemed the obvious choice. We only meant to stay for a year, but we liked it so much that we still live there. So most of Bel was written in England.\\n\\nIn the fall of 2019, Bel was finally finished. Like McCarthy's original Lisp, it's a spec rather than an implementation, although like McCarthy's Lisp it's a spec expressed as code.\\n\\nNow that I could write essays again, I wrote a bunch about topics I'd had stacked up. I kept writing essays through 2020, but I also started to think about other things I could work on. How should I choose what to do? Well, how had I chosen what to work on in the past? I wrote an essay for myself to answer that question, and I was surprised how long and messy the answer turned out to be. If this surprised me, who'd lived it, then I thought perhaps it would be interesting to other people, and encouraging to those with similarly messy lives. So I wrote a more detailed version for others to read, and this is the last sentence of it.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNotes\\n\\n[1] My experience skipped a step in the evolution of computers: time-sharing machines with interactive OSes. I went straight from batch processing to microcomputers, which made microcomputers seem all the more exciting.\\n\\n[2] Italian words for abstract concepts can nearly always be predicted from their English cognates (except for occasional traps like polluzione). It's the everyday words that differ. So if you string together a lot of abstract concepts with a few simple verbs, you can make a little Italian go a long way.\\n\\n[3] I lived at Piazza San Felice 4, so my walk to the Accademia went straight down the spine of old Florence: past the Pitti, across the bridge, past Orsanmichele, between the Duomo and the Baptistery, and then up Via Ricasoli to Piazza San Marco.\""

      "Question: What were the two main things the author worked on before college?\n",
      "Answer: The author worked on writing and programming before college.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What were the limitations of the 1401 computer and why couldn't the author do much with it?\n",
      "Answer: The author mentions that the 1401 computer had limitations in terms of input. The only form of input to programs was data stored on punched cards, and the author did not have any data stored on punched cards. Additionally, the author did not know enough math to do anything interesting that did not rely on input. Therefore, the author couldn't do much with the 1401 computer due to these limitations.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What was the author's first experience with computers and programming?\n",
      "Answer: The author's first experience with computers and programming was in 9th grade when they had access to an IBM 1401 computer in the basement of their junior high school. They used an early version of Fortran and had to type programs on punch cards. However, they were puzzled by the 1401 and didn't know what to do with it, as they didn't have any data stored on punched cards. They couldn't remember any programs they wrote on that machine.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What were the two things that inspired the author to work on AI?\n",
      "Answer: The two things that inspired the author to work on AI were a novel by Heinlein called The Moon is a Harsh Mistress, which featured an intelligent computer called Mike, and a PBS documentary that showed Terry Winograd using SHRDLU.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What was the author's undergraduate thesis about?\n",
      "Answer: The context information does not provide any information about the author's undergraduate thesis.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What realization did the author have during their first year of grad school regarding AI?\n",
      "Answer: The author realized that the way AI was being practiced at the time, with programs translating natural language into formal representations, was not effective in actually understanding natural language. They recognized that there was an unbridgeable gap between what these programs could do and true comprehension of natural language. The author concluded that the approach of using explicit data structures to represent concepts in AI was not going to work.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What motivated the author to write a book about Lisp hacking?\n",
      "Answer: The author was motivated to write a book about Lisp hacking because they wanted to learn more about it. They believed that writing a book about something would help them learn it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What realization did the author have while visiting the Carnegie Institute?\n",
      "Answer: The author realized that paintings were something that could be created and would last, unlike the systems work they had been doing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What was the author's initial perception of people who made art?\n",
      "Answer: The author initially perceived people who made art as either living long ago or being mysterious geniuses doing strange things in profiles in Life magazine. The idea of actually being able to make art seemed almost miraculous to the author.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What was the author's initial plan for their dissertation topic?\n",
      "Answer: The author's initial plan for their dissertation topic was to write about applications of continuations.\n",

      "Question: What arrangement had the students and faculty in the painting department at the Accademia arrived at?\n",
      "Answer: The students and faculty in the painting department at the Accademia had arrived at an arrangement whereby the students wouldn't require the faculty to teach anything, and in return the faculty wouldn't require the students to learn anything.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What is the difference between painting still lives and painting people?\n",
      "Answer: Painting still lives and painting people differ in terms of the subject's ability to move. Still lives, as the name suggests, are objects that cannot move, allowing the artist to closely observe and potentially copy them pixel by pixel. On the other hand, people can only sit for a limited amount of time and tend to move, making it necessary for the artist to have a generic understanding of how to paint a person and then modify it to match the specific individual being painted.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What is the purpose of low-level processes in visual perception?\n",
      "Answer: The purpose of low-level processes in visual perception is to identify and categorize objects or elements in the environment without providing detailed information about their specific characteristics or attributes. These processes serve to filter out unnecessary details and allow the brain to focus on the most relevant and important aspects of the visual scene.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What was the main difference between Interleaf's software and Microsoft Word?\n",
      "Answer: The main difference between Interleaf's software and Microsoft Word was that Interleaf's software had a scripting language, inspired by Emacs and based on Lisp, while Microsoft Word did not have this feature.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What did the author learn about technology companies while working at Interleaf?\n",
      "Answer: The author learned several things about technology companies while working at Interleaf. They learned that it is better for technology companies to be run by product people rather than sales people. They also learned that it leads to bugs when code is edited by too many people, and that cheap office space is not worth it if it is depressing. Additionally, the author learned that planned meetings are inferior to corridor conversations, that big bureaucratic customers can be a dangerous source of money, and that there is not much overlap between conventional office hours and the optimal time for hacking.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: According to the author, why is it advantageous to be the 'entry level' option?\n",
      "Answer: Being the 'entry level' option is advantageous because if you're not, someone else will be, and they will surpass you and limit your growth potential. Additionally, being the 'entry level' option allows you to cater to a wider audience and capture a larger market share.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What is the purpose of a signature style in painting?\n",
      "Answer: The purpose of a signature style in painting is to create a visual identity that immediately distinguishes the work as belonging to a specific artist. It serves as a way for artists to express themselves and make their work easily recognizable and unique. Additionally, having a signature style can increase the value and desirability of the artwork, as buyers are often willing to pay more for pieces that have a distinctive and recognizable style.\n",

      "\n",
      "Question: What was the initial plan for building online stores in the summer of 1995?\n",
      "Answer: The initial plan for building online stores in the summer of 1995 was to develop normal desktop software, specifically Windows software. However, the individuals involved in the project were not familiar with writing Windows software and preferred to work in the Unix world. As a result, they decided to create a prototype store builder on Unix instead.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What is a web app and why was it considered groundbreaking at the time?\n",
      "Answer: A web app is a type of software that can be accessed and used through a web browser without the need for any additional client software or command line input. It was considered groundbreaking at the time because it demonstrated that it was possible to build and control a whole store through a browser, without the need for traditional client-server software or manual input on the server. This approach eliminated the need for software versions, ports, and other complexities, allowing for easier updates and maintenance directly on the server. This concept opened up new possibilities for software development and paved the way for a new generation of software that could be accessed and used solely through a browser.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What was the significance of the deal mentioned in the context information for Y Combinator?\n",
      "Answer: The deal mentioned in the context information for Y Combinator was significant because it provided funding for startups in return for a percentage of equity. This deal allowed Y Combinator to scale startup funding by investing in batches of startups, which was more convenient for Y Combinator and provided a supportive community for the founders. Additionally, the deal helped solve the problem of isolation faced by founders and allowed startups to become each other's customers, creating a network effect.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: Who did Robert recommend as a programmer to recruit?\n",
      "Answer: Robert recommended Trevor Blackwell as a programmer to recruit.\n",
      "\n",

      "Answer: The three main parts of the software mentioned in the context are the editor, the shopping cart, and the manager.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What is the significance of 'doing things that don't scale' in the context of the startup?\n",
      "Answer: The significance of 'doing things that don't scale' in the context of the startup is that it helped the startup gain users and grow. Although it may have seemed humiliating to build stores for users when the software was meant for users to make their own stores, it was a desperate measure to attract users. This approach taught the startup about retail and how it felt to use their software, which ultimately contributed to their growth. It highlights the importance of prioritizing user acquisition and satisfaction over scalability in the early stages of a startup.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What is the ultimate test of a startup's success according to the author?\n",

The author mentions that their Viaweb stock was valuable in principle, but they were not sure how to value a business. Additionally, the author was constantly aware of the near-death experiences the company faced and had not significantly changed their lifestyle since starting the company. Therefore, when Yahoo bought the company, it felt like going from a state of financial uncertainty to a state of wealth and security.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: Why did the author leave Yahoo after their options vested?\n",
      "Answer: The author left Yahoo after their options vested because they had originally joined the company with the goal of getting rich so they could pursue their passion for painting. Now that they had become rich, they decided it was time to leave and focus on their artistic pursuits.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: Why did the author advise founders who sell their companies to take a vacation?\n",
      "Answer: The author advises founders who sell their companies to take a vacation because they believe it is important to take a break and relax after such a significant event.\n",

Only a few officially recognized thinkers who attended the right parties in New York and specialists writing about their specialties were allowed to publish essays. This meant that there were many essays that had never been written because there was no way to publish them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What is the significance of Lisp in the author's writing and how does it compare to Latin?\n",
      "Answer: The author finds Lisp significant because of its origins as a model of computation and its power and elegance as a programming language. The author was attracted to Lisp in college, although they didn't fully understand why at the time. Lisp's core is a language defined by writing an interpreter in itself, which sets it apart from other programming languages. In comparison, Latin is not mentioned in the given context, so we cannot determine its significance to the author's writing.\n",
      "\n",

      "Answer: Julian helped the author and their team in setting up their company by getting them incorporated, with bylaws and stock and all the necessary paperwork.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What was the purpose of organizing a summer program for undergrads to start startups?\n",
      "Answer: The purpose of organizing a summer program for undergrads to start startups was to provide them with a more interesting summer experience than working at companies like Microsoft. Additionally, it allowed the organizers to practice being investors and gain experience in the field.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: Who were some of the notable individuals in the first batch of the Summer Founders Program?\n",
      "Answer: Some of the notable individuals in the first batch of the Summer Founders Program were reddit, Justin Kan and Emmett Shear (who went on to found Twitch), Aaron Swartz (who had already helped write the RSS spec and would later become a martyr for open access), and Sam Altman (who would later become the second president of YC).\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What are some advantages of scale that YC noticed as it grew?\n",
      "Answer: YC noticed several advantages of scale as it grew. One advantage was that the alumni became a tight community dedicated to helping one another, especially the current batch. Another advantage was that the startups in the program started to become each other's customers. YC also noticed that many startups were able to get their initial set of customers from among their batchmates.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: Why did the author change the name of the platform to Hacker News?\n",
      "Answer: The author changed the name of the platform to Hacker News because they wanted to reach future startup founders, not just current startup founders. They believed that the name \"Hacker News\" would be more appealing and engaging to those who had an intellectual curiosity, rather than focusing solely on startups.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What made YC different from other kinds of work the author had done?\n",
      "Answer: The problems came to the author instead of the author deciding what to work on. Every 6 months, there was a new batch of startups with their own problems, which became the author's problems. This made the work engaging and allowed the author to learn a lot about startups in a short amount of time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: Why did Rtm offer unsolicited advice to the author?\n",
      "Answer: Rtm offered unsolicited advice to the author because he wanted to make sure that Y Combinator wasn't the last cool thing the author did.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: Why did the founders of YC decide to recruit Sam Altman as the new president?\n",
      "Answer: The founders of YC decided to recruit Sam Altman as the new president because they wanted YC to last for a long time and believed that it couldn't be controlled by the founders. They wanted to ensure a complete changing of the guard and allow someone else to reorganize YC. Initially, Sam Altman said no to the offer, as he wanted to start a startup to make nuclear reactors. However, the founders persisted and eventually convinced him to take on the role.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What did the author decide to do after stopping work on YC?\n",
      "Answer: After stopping work on YC, the author decided to start painting. They wanted to see how good they could get at painting if they really focused on it. They spent most of the rest of 2014 painting and were able to improve their skills. However, in November, they ran out of steam and stopped working on a painting. After that, they started writing essays again and eventually started working on Lisp.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What is the distinctive feature of Lisp that sets it apart from other programming languages?\n",
      "Answer: Lisp is distinctive because its core is a language defined by writing an interpreter in itself. It was originally intended as a formal model of computation, rather than a programming language in the ordinary sense. This feature gives Lisp a power and elegance that other languages cannot match.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What was the reason why McCarthy's original axiomatic approach couldn't be used to define the added features?\n",
      "Answer: The reason why McCarthy's original axiomatic approach couldn't be used to define the added features is because it wouldn't have been feasible at the time. McCarthy tested his interpreter by hand-simulating the execution of programs, but as the interpreter became more complicated, it would have required running it on computers that weren't powerful enough at that time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What challenges did the author face while working on Bel?\n",
      "Answer: The author faced challenges while working on Bel, particularly in understanding the code due to the complexity of the problem.

      "Answer: After the author's company was bought by Yahoo, they felt a huge relief. Although their Viaweb stock was valuable in principle, it didn't feel valuable to the author personally due to the constant near-death experiences they had while running the company. The author had no idea how to value a business and had not changed their lifestyle significantly since starting the company. Therefore, when Yahoo bought them, it felt like going from rags to riches. The author bought a car and considered its leather seats to be the most luxurious thing they owned. However, the following year was the least productive of the author's life. They were worn out from the effort and stress of running the company, and the culture and environment at Yahoo gradually dragged them down. Eventually, the author left Yahoo after the first chunk of options vested, as they had originally started the company to get rich so they could pursue their passion for painting.\n",

      "Question: Why did the author find encouragement in the marginal nature of online essays?\n",
      "Answer: The author found encouragement in the marginal nature of online essays because they knew that socially, online essays would initially be seen as more like rants posted by \"nutjobs\" on their GeoCities sites rather than the polished compositions published in prestigious magazines like The New Yorker. However, the author found this encouraging because they believed that working on things that weren't prestigious was a sign that there was something real to be discovered and that they had the right motives. They believed that the desire to impress people could lead one astray, so working on less prestigious things at least guaranteed that they were not on the most common type of wrong track.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: Why does the author believe that being drawn to work that lacks prestige can be a sign of something valuable?\n",
      "Answer: Being drawn to work that lacks prestige can be a sign of something valuable because it indicates that there is something real to be discovered in that field and that the individual has the right kind of motives. The author suggests that working on things that are not prestigious may not guarantee that one is on the right track, but it at least ensures that they are not on the most common type of wrong one. The desire to impress people and seek prestige can lead to impure motives, which can be a danger for the ambitious. Therefore, being drawn to unprestigious work can be a positive sign as it suggests a genuine interest in exploring new ideas and opportunities.\n",

      "\n",
      "Question: What is the most distinctive feature of YC's funding model?\n",
      "Answer: The most distinctive feature of YC's funding model is the batch model. YC funds a group of startups all at once, twice a year, and then spends three months intensively focusing on helping them. This approach was discovered by accident due to the founders' ignorance about investing, but it has proven to be successful in providing support and creating a community for the startups.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: How did the Summer Founders Program attract applicants?\n",
      "Answer: The Summer Founders Program attracted applicants by posting an announcement on the author's website and inviting undergrads to apply.

      "Answer: The founders' decision to reorganize YC and let someone else take control was driven by their desire for YC to last for a long time. They believed that in order for YC to have longevity, it couldn't be controlled solely by the founders. Therefore, they decided to recruit someone else to take over and reorganize YC, with the founders retiring and becoming ordinary partners.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: Why did the author stop working on painting?\n",
      "Answer: The author stopped working on painting because they didn't seem to have any energy or ambition for it. Additionally, part of the problem was that they didn't know many people in California, and they had bought a house in a remote location, which compounded the issue.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: How did Lisp evolve from being a formal model of computation to a programming language?\n",
      "Answer: Lisp evolved from being a formal model of computation to a programming language when John McCarthy's grad student, Steve Russell, suggested that McCarthy's Lisp interpreter could be used to program computers. Russell then translated McCarthy's interpreter into IBM 704 machine language, which allowed Lisp to be used as a programming language in the ordinary sense. McCarthy's original Lisp interpreter was missing many features that are typically found in programming languages, so these had to be added over time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: Why was it difficult to test a more complicated interpreter using McCarthy's approach at the time?\n",
      "Answer: Testing a more complicated interpreter using McCarthy's approach was difficult at the time because computers then were not powerful enough. McCarthy tested his interpreter by hand-simulating the execution of programs, but as the interpreters became more complex, it became impractical to test them in this way. To test a more complicated interpreter, it would have been necessary to run it on a computer, but the computers of that time did not have enough power to handle the complexity of the interpreter.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: How did the author manage to work on Bel intensively?\n",

This intense focus and dedication allowed them to make significant progress on Bel.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: How did the author describe the completion of Bel in the fall of 2019?\n",
      "Answer: The author described the completion of Bel in the fall of 2019 as a finished project that is a specification rather than an implementation, similar to McCarthy's original Lisp.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What is the relationship between Italian and English words in terms of abstract concepts and everyday words?\n",
      "Answer: Italian words for abstract concepts can nearly always be predicted from their English cognates, except for occasional traps. However, it's the everyday words that differ between Italian and English. So, if you string together a lot of abstract concepts with a few simple verbs, you can make a little Italian go a long way.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What is the difference between rent-controlled and rent-stabilized apartments, and why is it significant in the context of the passage?\n",
      "Answer: Rent-controlled apartments and rent-stabilized apartments are terms used to describe different types of regulated housing in New York City. Rent-controlled apartments are subject to strict regulations on rent increases and eviction protections. These regulations are typically applied to buildings constructed before 1947 and have been continuously occupied by the same tenant or their family members since before July 1, 1971. Rent-stabilized apartments, on the other hand, are subject to less strict regulations and are typically found in buildings constructed between 1947 and 1974 with six or more units.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the context of the passage, the significance of distinguishing between rent-controlled and rent-stabilized apartments is that the author is highlighting the fact that their apartment was really cheap, less than half the market price. By mentioning that the apartment was technically rent-stabilized, the author is indicating that they were able to secure affordable housing in a city known for its high cost of living. This detail helps to emphasize the author's personal experience and the financial advantages they had while living in New York City.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What is the significance of treating the online version as the primary version when publishing online?\n",
      "Answer: Treating the online version as the primary version when publishing online is significant because it allows for a wider audience and greater accessibility. In the print era, the channel for publishing essays was limited and controlled by editors. Only a select few specialists were allowed to publish essays about their specialties. This meant that many essays went unwritten because there was no way to publish them. However, with the advent of the internet, anyone could publish anything online. By treating the online version as the primary version, the author can reach a larger audience and bypass the traditional gatekeepers of publishing. This opens up the opportunity for more essays to be written and shared with the world.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: Why did the founder choose orange as the color for Y Combinator?\n",
      "Answer: The founder chose orange as the color for Y Combinator partly because it is the warmest color and partly because no venture capitalist (VC) used it at the time. The VCs were using more traditional colors like maroon, navy blue, and forest green to appeal to limited partners (LPs), not founders.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What problem arises when running a forum and writing essays simultaneously?\n",
      "Answer: Running a forum and writing essays simultaneously can be challenging because it requires dividing one's time and attention between two different tasks. This can lead to a lack of focus and potentially result in a decrease in the quality of both the forum management and the essay writing. Additionally, managing a forum involves engaging with the community, moderating discussions, and addressing any issues that may arise, which can be time-consuming and take away from the time available for writing essays. Conversely, writing essays requires concentration, research, and reflection, which may be difficult to achieve when also managing a forum. Therefore, balancing these two activities can be a problem for individuals trying to do both simultaneously.\n",

      "\n",
      "Question: What topic did the author choose for their dissertation and why?\n",
      "Answer: The author chose applications of continuations as the topic for their dissertation. They mentioned that in retrospect, they should have written about macros and embedded languages, as there is a whole world there that has barely been explored.

      "\n",
      "Question: What is the difference between painting still lives and painting people?\n",
      "Answer: Painting still lives and painting people differ in terms of the subject's ability to move. Still lives, as the name suggests, are objects that cannot move, allowing the artist to closely observe and potentially copy them pixel by pixel. On the other hand, people can only sit for a limited amount of time and tend to move, making it necessary for the artist to have a generic understanding of how to paint a person and then modify it to match the specific individual being painted.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What does the author mean by 'emphasizing the visual cues' in a still life painting?\n",
      "Answer: By 'emphasizing the visual cues' in a still life painting, the author means highlighting the details and characteristics that indicate certain aspects of the objects being painted. This could include features like the sudden change in color at the edge of an object, which signifies its boundary. The author suggests that by subtly emphasizing these visual cues, the artist can create paintings that are more realistic than photographs, not just in a metaphorical sense, but in terms of conveying detailed information about the objects being depicted.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Question: How did the author benefit financially from working at Interleaf?\n",
      "Answer: The author benefited financially from working at Interleaf by getting paid a significant amount of money, especially compared to their previous budget as an art student. They were paid more than four times their previous daily budget every hour, even when they were just sitting in a meeting. This allowed them to save enough money to go back to RISD and pay off their college loans.\n",

      "Question: In the context of art school, what is a 'signature style' and why do buyers pay a lot for such work?\n",
      "Answer: A 'signature style' in the context of art school refers to a visual style that immediately identifies the work as belonging to a specific artist. It is something unique and distinctive that sets the artist's work apart from others. Buyers often pay a lot for artwork with a signature style because it carries the artist's personal brand and is seen as a mark of quality and originality. It becomes a recognizable and sought-after characteristic, which can increase the value and desirability of the artwork.\n",

      "Answer: The author's startup idea was to start their own investment firm and implement the ideas they had been discussing. However, the startup idea was not successful because they had no prior knowledge or experience in angel investing, and there were no mentors or established angel investors in Boston in 2005 to learn from. Despite their lack of expertise, they made what seemed like obvious choices and some of their decisions turned out to be novel.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Question: What was the significance of the version of the store builder created on August 12?\n",
      "Answer: The significance of the version of the store builder created on August 12 was that it proved that a whole store could be built through the browser without any client software or typing anything into the command line on the server.

      "Answer: The WYSIWYG site builder had the feature of allowing users to create pages that looked exactly like the static ones that would be generated later. However, instead of leading to static pages, the links in the WYSIWYG site builder referred to closures stored in a hash table on the server. This differed from traditional static pages, where the links would directly lead to separate static pages.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: How did the author's background in art help in building an online store builder?\n",
      "Answer: The author's background in art did not directly help in building an online store builder. The author initially started a company to put art galleries online, but this idea did not succeed. It was only later, when the author realized that online stores were similar to the sites they had been generating for galleries, that they decided to shift their focus to building online stores. The author's background in art did not play a role in this shift, as they were primarily focused on developing software and building online stores, rather than leveraging their art background.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What was the state of online stores when the business opened in January 1996?\n",
      "Answer: The state of online stores when the business opened in January 1996 was still in its early stages. The concept of building online stores was relatively new, and the founders of the business were trying to develop software to create these stores. They initially planned to create desktop software for Windows, but later decided to build a prototype store builder on Unix. They eventually developed a version of their store builder that could be controlled through a browser, proving that it was possible to build a whole store without any client software or typing anything into the command line on the server.\n",

      "\n",
      "Question: How did the author feel when Yahoo bought their company?\n",
      "Answer: The author felt a huge relief when Yahoo bought their company. They considered their Viaweb stock to be valuable in principle, but personally, it didn't feel very valuable to them. They were all too aware of the near-death experiences they had every few months and had not significantly changed their lifestyle since starting the company. Therefore, when Yahoo bought them, it felt like going from rags to riches for the author.\n",
