    "\n",
    "LLMs are trained on vast datasets, but these will not include your specific data (things like company knowledge bases and documentation). Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) addresses this by dynamically incorporating your data as context during the generation process. This is done not by altering the training data of the LLMs but by allowing the model to access and utilize your data in real-time to provide more tailored and contextually relevant responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "In RAG, your data is loaded and prepared for queries. This process is called indexing. User queries act on this index, which filters your data down to the most relevant context. This context and your query then are sent to the LLM along with a prompt, and the LLM provides a response.\n",
    "\n",
    "RAG is a critical component for building applications such a chatbots or agents and you will want to know RAG techniques on how to get data into your application.\n",

    "## Stages within RAG\n",
    "\n",
    "There are five key stages within RAG, which will in turn be a part of any larger RAG application.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Loading**: This refers to getting your data from where it lives - whether it's text files, PDFs, another website, a database or an API - into your pipeline.\n",
    "- **Indexing**: This means creating a data structure that allows for querying the data. For LLMs this nearly always means creating vector embeddings, numerical representations of the meaning of your data, as well as numerous other metadata strategies to make it easy to accurately find contextually relevant data.\n",
    "- **Storing**: Once your data is indexed, you will want to store your index, along with any other metadata, to avoid the need to re-index it.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Querying**: For any given indexing strategy there are many ways you can utilize LLMs and data structures to query, including sub-queries, multi-step queries, and hybrid strategies. \n",
    "- **Evaluation**: A critical step in any pipeline is checking how effective it is relative to other strategies, or when you make changes. Evaluation provides objective measures on how accurate, faithful, and fast your responses to queries are.\n"

       "'What I Worked On\\n\\nFebruary 2021\\n\\nBefore college the two main things I worked on, outside of school, were writing and programming. I didn\\'t write essays. I wrote what beginning writers were supposed to write then, and probably still are: short stories. My stories were awful. They had hardly any plot, just characters with strong feelings, which I imagined made them deep.\\n\\nThe first programs I tried writing were on the IBM 1401 that our school district used for what was then called \"data processing.\" This was in 9th grade, so I was 13 or 14. The school district\\'s 1401 happened to be in the basement of our junior high school, and my friend Rich Draves and I got permission to use it. It was like a mini Bond villain\\'s lair down there, with all these alien-looking machines — CPU, disk drives, printer, card reader — sitting up on a raised floor under bright fluorescent lights.\\n\\nThe language we used was an early version of Fortran. You had to type programs on punch cards, then stack them in the card reader and press a button to load the program into memory and run it. The result would ordinarily be to print something on the spectacularly loud printer.\\n\\nI was puzzled by the 1401. I couldn\\'t figure out what to do with it. And in retrospect there\\'s not much I could have done with it. The only form of input to programs was data stored on punched cards, and I didn\\'t have any data stored on punched cards. The only other option was to do things that didn\\'t rely on any input, like calculate approximations of pi, but I didn\\'t know enough math to do anything interesting of that type. So I\\'m not surprised I can\\'t remember any programs I wrote, because they can\\'t have done much. My clearest memory is of the moment I learned it was possible for programs not to terminate, when one of mine didn\\'t. On a machine without time-sharing, this was a social as well as a technical error, as the data center manager\\'s expression made clear.\\n\\nWith microcomputers, everything changed.'"

       "\"I remember taking the boys to the coast on a sunny day in 2015 and figuring out how to deal with some problem involving continuations while I watched them play in the tide pools. It felt like I was doing life right. I remember that because I was slightly dismayed at how novel it felt. The good news is that I had more moments like this over the next few years.\\n\\nIn the summer of 2016 we moved to England. We wanted our kids to see what it was like living in another country, and since I was a British citizen by birth, that seemed the obvious choice. We only meant to stay for a year, but we liked it so much that we still live there. So most of Bel was written in England.\\n\\nIn the fall of 2019, Bel was finally finished. Like McCarthy's original Lisp, it's a spec rather than an implementation, although like McCarthy's Lisp it's a spec expressed as code.\\n\\nNow that I could write essays again, I wrote a bunch about topics I'd had stacked up. I kept writing essays through 2020, but I also started to think about other things I could work on. How should I choose what to do? Well, how had I chosen what to work on in the past? I wrote an essay for myself to answer that question, and I was surprised how long and messy the answer turned out to be. If this surprised me, who'd lived it, then I thought perhaps it would be interesting to other people, and encouraging to those with similarly messy lives. So I wrote a more detailed version for others to read, and this is the last sentence of it.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNotes\\n\\n[1] My experience skipped a step in the evolution of computers: time-sharing machines with interactive OSes. I went straight from batch processing to microcomputers, which made microcomputers seem all the more exciting.\\n\\n[2] Italian words for abstract concepts can nearly always be predicted from their English cognates (except for occasional traps like polluzione). It's the everyday words that differ. So if you string together a lot of abstract concepts with a few simple verbs, you can make a little Italian go a long way.\""

      "Question: Explain the author's realization about AI during their first year of grad school. What did they conclude about the traditional way of doing AI?\n",
      "Answer: The author realized during their first year of grad school that the traditional way of doing AI, which involved programs translating natural language into formal representations and adding them to a list of known things, was flawed. They concluded that these programs only demonstrated a subset of natural language that was a formal language, but a very limited one. The author recognized an unbridgeable gap between what these programs could do and actual understanding of natural language. They believed that simply teaching these programs more words would not solve the fundamental issue with the traditional approach to AI, which relied on explicit data structures representing concepts.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What were the two main projects the author was working on during their time at Y Combinator?\n",
      "Answer: Writing essays and working on Y Combinator.\n",

      "\n",
      "Question: What was the author's experience like studying at the Accademia and why did they ultimately decide to return to the US?\n",
      "Answer: The author's experience at the Accademia involved a lack of substantial learning as the faculty and students had an arrangement where teaching and learning were not emphasized. The author received good grades for working hard, but the institution mainly taught Italian. Ultimately, the author decided to return to the US because the Accademia wasn't providing the desired educational experience, and the author's funds were running low.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: Describe the author's daily walk from Piazza San Felice 4 to the Accademia in Florence. What did they observe along the way?\n",
      "Answer: The author's daily walk from Piazza San Felice 4 to the Accademia in Florence involved passing by several notable landmarks. The route took them straight down the spine of old Florence, past the Pitti Palace, across a bridge, past Orsanmichele, between the Duomo and the Baptistery, and then up Via Ricasoli to Piazza San Marco. Along this path, the author observed Florence at street level in various conditions, from empty dark winter evenings to bustling summer days filled with tourists.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What realization led the author to switch from building a company to working on an open source project?\n",

      "\n",
      "Question: How did the responsibilities at YC shift between the founders and Sam Altman leading up to the winter 2014 batch?\n",
      "Answer: Robert and the original founder gradually handed over more responsibilities to Sam Altman leading up to the winter 2014 batch. Initially, Sam was reluctant to become the president of YC as he wanted to pursue a startup involving nuclear reactors. However, after persistent efforts, Sam agreed in October 2013 to take over, starting with the winter 2014 batch. This transition involved Robert and the original founder stepping back from their roles, allowing Sam to reorganize YC and take on more leadership responsibilities.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: How does the process of creating still life paintings differ from painting people in terms of capturing details and visual cues?\n",
      "Answer: Creating still life paintings allows for a more meticulous approach in capturing details and visual cues compared to painting people. While painting people involves modifying a generic person to match the specific individual being painted, still life painting permits the artist to potentially replicate the scene pixel by pixel from what is being observed. This meticulous approach in still life painting enables the artist to emphasize visual cues such as color changes, object edges, and other intricate details that contribute to creating a realistic representation that surpasses mere photographic accuracy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: How did the narrator's discussion with Robert and Trevor lead to the idea of starting their own investment firm?\n",
      "Answer: The narrator's discussion with Robert and Trevor about potential projects they could collaborate on led to the idea of starting their own investment firm.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: How did the author's experience with programming change when they started working with microcomputers? Explain the significance of this change in their programming journey.\n",

This was a departure from the previous method of using punch cards on larger machines like the IBM 1401. The shift to microcomputers allowed for a more interactive and dynamic programming experience, enabling the author to write programs more efficiently and see the results instantly. This change marked a pivotal moment in the author's programming journey, as it opened up new possibilities and sparked a deeper interest and engagement in programming.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: Discuss the author's perspective on the field of Computer Science as described in the text. How did they view the relationship between theory and systems in Computer Science?\n",
      "Answer: The author of the text expresses a preference for the practical aspect of Computer Science, leaning towards building things rather than focusing solely on theoretical aspects. They acknowledge the importance of theory but find building things more exciting. The author highlights the dichotomy in Computer Science between theory, where people prove things, and systems, where people build things. They emphasize a desire to create lasting work in the field, recognizing the transient nature of systems work. The author's perspective suggests a preference for hands-on, practical work that has a lasting impact over purely theoretical endeavors.\n",

      "Answer: The narrator had the idea to start a new company called Aspra, which was going to be an \"application service provider\" (ASP) or \"software as a service\" company.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What did the author learn about software development while working at Interleaf, and how did this experience shape their understanding of the industry?\n",
      "Answer: The author learned about the dynamics between low-end and high-end software at Interleaf. They discovered that low-end software can often overshadow high-end software. This experience shaped the author's understanding of the industry by highlighting the importance of software compatibility and the impact of different software tiers on each other.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: Explain how companies like Interleaf were affected by Moore's Law in the 1990s. What role did commodity processors play in this process?\n",
      "Answer: Companies like Interleaf were impacted by Moore's Law in the 1990s as the exponential growth in the power of commodity processors, such as Intel processors, played a significant role. The rapid advancement in the capabilities of these commodity processors made it challenging for companies like Interleaf, which had smart people and impressive technology, to compete. The increasing power of these processors essentially overshadowed the high-end, special-purpose hardware and software companies, leading to their downfall as they struggled to keep up with the pace set by Moore's Law.\n",
      "\n",

      "Answer: After leaving Y Combinator, the author decided to focus on painting. They spent most of 2014 painting, dedicating their time to improving their skills in this artistic pursuit.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: Discuss the significance of emphasizing visual cues in still life paintings to achieve a level of realism beyond photographic accuracy.\n",
      "Answer: Emphasizing visual cues in still life paintings allows artists to capture details that go beyond mere photographic accuracy. By highlighting subtle visual cues such as the abrupt color changes at the edges of objects, artists can create paintings that are more realistic in a profound information-theoretic sense. This attention to detail and emphasis on visual cues not only adds depth and dimension to the artwork but also conveys a sense of realism that surpasses what a photograph can capture. It enables the artist to infuse the still life with a sense of depth, texture, and presence that goes beyond a mere replication of the scene, resulting in a more engaging and immersive visual experience for the viewer.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What was the unique approach taken by the narrator and his partners in becoming angel investors, and how did it differ from traditional VC firms and individual angels?\n",
      "Answer: The unique approach taken by the narrator and his partners in becoming angel investors was to combine the aspects of traditional VC firms and individual angels. They aimed to make smaller seed investments like individual angels but also provide comprehensive support to startups like traditional VC firms. This approach differed from traditional VC firms that focused on large investments and individual angels who typically made investments on the side without offering extensive support to founders.\n",
