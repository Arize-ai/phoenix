    "\n",
    "LLMs are trained on vast datasets, but these will not include your specific data (things like company knowledge bases and documentation). Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) addresses this by dynamically incorporating your data as context during the generation process. This is done not by altering the training data of the LLMs but by allowing the model to access and utilize your data in real-time to provide more tailored and contextually relevant responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "In RAG, your data is loaded and prepared for queries. This process is called indexing. User queries act on this index, which filters your data down to the most relevant context. This context and your query then are sent to the LLM along with a prompt, and the LLM provides a response.\n",
    "\n",
    "RAG is a critical component for building applications such a chatbots or agents and you will want to know RAG techniques on how to get data into your application.\n",

    "## Stages within RAG\n",
    "\n",
    "There are five key stages within RAG, which will in turn be a part of any larger RAG application.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Loading**: This refers to getting your data from where it lives - whether it's text files, PDFs, another website, a database or an API - into your pipeline.\n",
    "- **Indexing**: This means creating a data structure that allows for querying the data. For LLMs this nearly always means creating vector embeddings, numerical representations of the meaning of your data, as well as numerous other metadata strategies to make it easy to accurately find contextually relevant data.\n",
    "- **Storing**: Once your data is indexed, you will want to store your index, along with any other metadata, to avoid the need to re-index it.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Querying**: For any given indexing strategy there are many ways you can utilize LLMs and data structures to query, including sub-queries, multi-step queries, and hybrid strategies. \n",
    "- **Evaluation**: A critical step in any pipeline is checking how effective it is relative to other strategies, or when you make changes. Evaluation provides objective measures on how accurate, faithful, and fast your responses to queries are.\n"

       "\"I certainly did. So at the end of the summer Dan and I switched to working on this new dialect of Lisp, which I called Arc, in a house I bought in Cambridge.\\n\\nThe following spring, lightning struck. I was invited to give a talk at a Lisp conference, so I gave one about how we'd used Lisp at Viaweb. Afterward I put a postscript file of this talk online, on paulgraham.com, which I'd created years before using Viaweb but had never used for anything. In one day it got 30,000 page views. What on earth had happened? The referring urls showed that someone had posted it on Slashdot. [10]\\n\\nWow, I thought, there's an audience. If I write something and put it on the web, anyone can read it. That may seem obvious now, but it was surprising then. In the print era there was a narrow channel to readers, guarded by fierce monsters known as editors. The only way to get an audience for anything you wrote was to get it published as a book, or in a newspaper or magazine. Now anyone could publish anything.\\n\\nThis had been possible in principle since 1993, but not many people had realized it yet. I had been intimately involved with building the infrastructure of the web for most of that time, and a writer as well, and it had taken me 8 years to realize it. Even then it took me several years to understand the implications. It meant there would be a whole new generation of essays. [11]\\n\\nIn the print era, the channel for publishing essays had been vanishingly small. Except for a few officially anointed thinkers who went to the right parties in New York, the only people allowed to publish essays were specialists writing about their specialties. There were so many essays that had never been written, because there had been no way to publish them. Now they could be, and I was going to write them. [12]\\n\\nI've worked on several different things, but to the extent there was a turning point where I figured out what to work on, it was when I started publishing essays online. From then on I knew that whatever else I did, I'd always write essays too.\""

So in 1993 I dropped out. I hung around Providence for a bit, and then my college friend Nancy Parmet did me a big favor. A rent-controlled apartment in a building her mother owned in New York was becoming vacant. Did I want it? It wasn't much more than my current place, and New York was supposed to be where the artists were. So yes, I wanted it! [7]\\n\\nAsterix comics begin by zooming in on a tiny corner of Roman Gaul that turns out not to be controlled by the Romans. You can do something similar on a map of New York City: if you zoom in on the Upper East Side, there's a tiny corner that's not rich, or at least wasn't in 1993. It's called Yorkville, and that was my new home. Now I was a New York artist ‚Äî in the strictly technical sense of making paintings and living in New York.\\n\\nI was nervous about money, because I could sense that Interleaf was on the way down. Freelance Lisp hacking work was very rare, and I didn't want to have to program in another language, which in those days would have meant C++ if I was lucky. So with my unerring nose for financial opportunity, I decided to write another book on Lisp. This would be a popular book, the sort of book that could be used as a textbook. I imagined myself living frugally off the royalties and spending all my time painting. (The painting on the cover of this book, ANSI Common Lisp, is one that I painted around this time.)\\n\\nThe best thing about New York for me was the presence of Idelle and Julian Weber. Idelle Weber was a painter, one of the early photorealists, and I'd taken her painting class at Harvard. I've never known a teacher more beloved by her students.\""

      "Question: What type of stories did the author write before college and what were their main characteristics?\n",
      "Answer: Before college, the author wrote short stories. These stories were not particularly good, lacking a well-defined plot. Instead, they were characterized by strong emotions attributed to the characters, which the author mistakenly believed added depth to the narratives.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What was the first microcomputer the author's friend built from a kit, and who sold this kit?\n",
      "Answer: The first microcomputer the author's friend built from a kit was sold by Heathkit. The specific model name is not mentioned in the provided context.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What type of computer did the speaker convince his father to buy in around 1980, and what were some of the programs he wrote using this computer?\n",
      "Answer: The speaker convinced his father to buy a TRS-80 computer around 1980. With this computer, he wrote various programs including simple games, a program to predict the height his model rockets would fly, and a word processor. His father used this word processor to write at least one book, despite the limitation of only having room in memory for about 2 pages of text at a time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What was the name of the novel by Heinlein that inspired the individual to work on AI, and what was the name of the intelligent computer featured in it?\n",
      "Answer: The novel that inspired the individual to work on AI was \"The Moon is a Harsh Mistress\" by Robert A. Heinlein. The intelligent computer featured in this novel was named Mike.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What programming language did the author learn during his college years that significantly expanded his concept of a program?\n",
      "Answer: The author learned Lisp during his college years, which significantly expanded his concept of a program.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What led the author to realize that AI, as practiced at the time, was a 'hoax' and what did they identify as the main issue with this approach?\n",
      "Answer: The author realized that AI, as practiced at the time, was a 'hoax' during their first year of grad school. The main issue they identified with this approach was that it only worked with a very specific subset of natural language, which could be translated into a formal language. The author found a significant gap between what these AI programs could achieve and the actual understanding of natural language. They believed that simply teaching the AI more words or expanding its knowledge base would not bridge this gap. The author also mentioned that the method of using explicit data structures to represent concepts was fundamentally flawed and would not lead to the creation of a truly intelligent system.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What programming language did the author decide to focus on and write a book about, despite knowing very little about it at the time?\n",
      "Answer: The author decided to focus on Lisp and write a book about Lisp hacking, despite having limited knowledge about it at the time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What realization did the author have at the Carnegie Institute that surprised him, despite seeming obvious?\n",
      "Answer: The author realized at the Carnegie Institute that AI, as practiced at the time, was a hoax. This realization surprised him, despite seeming obvious, as he understood that the sort of AI where a program translates natural language into some formal representation and adds it to the list of things it knows was not going to work. He recognized an unbridgeable gap between what these programs could do and actually understanding natural language.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What was the author's initial perception about artists and the creation of art before he started taking art classes at Harvard?\n",
      "Answer: Before the author started taking art classes at Harvard, he had a perception that artists were a different species, either living long ago or being mysterious geniuses doing strange things. He knew intellectually that people made art, but the idea of actually being able to create art seemed almost miraculous to him. He had never imagined it was even possible and had no idea if he could make paintings himself.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: Why did the author decide to write his dissertation in a short period of time, and what was the topic he chose?\n",
      "Answer: The author decided to write his dissertation in a short period of time in order to graduate and get out of grad school. This decision was made after a conversation with Professor Cheatham, who asked if he was far enough along to graduate that June. Despite not having a word of his dissertation written, he decided to take a shot at writing one in the remaining 5 weeks, reusing parts of 'On Lisp' where he could. The topic he chose for his dissertation was applications of continuations.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What was the reason the author had to take the entrance exam at the Accademia, and what might have been the purpose of this exam?\n",
      "Answer: The author had to take the entrance exam at the Accademia because he was a foreigner. The purpose of this exam might have been to limit the number of foreign students, as their high numbers could potentially outnumber the Italian students. This is an inference drawn from the context provided, not from any prior knowledge.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What strategy did the author employ to answer the essay question in the written exam, given their limited vocabulary?\n",
      "Answer: The author cranked up the intellectual level of the essay as high as possible to make the most of their limited vocabulary. They chose to write about Cezanne for the essay question.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What was the profession of the model who lived down the street from the speaker, and how did she assist the local antique dealer?\n",
      "Answer: The model who lived down the street from the speaker had a unique profession. In addition to modeling, she also created fakes for a local antique dealer. This involved copying obscure old paintings from a book. Once she had made the copy, the antique dealer would then take it and deliberately damage or age it to give the appearance of authenticity.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What is the information-theoretic advantage of emphasizing visual cues in painting, as mentioned in the text?\n",
      "Answer: By emphasizing visual cues in painting, such as the sudden change of color indicating the edge of an object, one can create paintings that are more realistic than photographs in a strict information-theoretic sense. This is because these subtle emphasizes provide more detailed information about the scene, allowing the viewer to better understand and interpret what they are seeing. This approach to painting requires the artist to look closely at the details of the scene, noticing things that might otherwise go unnoticed in everyday life.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What was the name of the company where the author got a job after returning from the Accademia, and what kind of software did this company produce?\n",
      "Answer: The author got a job at a company called Interleaf after returning from the Accademia. This company produced software for creating documents, similar to Microsoft Word.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What did the author learn about the management of technology companies during his time at Interleaf?\n",
      "Answer: The author learned several things about the management of technology companies during his time at Interleaf. He found that it's better for such companies to be run by product people rather than sales people, although he acknowledged that sales is a real skill and those who are good at it are very good. He also discovered that it can lead to bugs when code is edited by too many people. Additionally, he realized that cheap office space is not a bargain if it's depressing, and that planned meetings are inferior to corridor conversations. He learned that big, bureaucratic customers can be a dangerous source of money, and that there's not much overlap between conventional office hours and the optimal time for hacking, or conventional offices and the optimal place for it.\n",
      "\n",
      "The most significant lesson he learned, which he later applied in both Viaweb and Y Combinator, is that the low end eats the high end. This means it's beneficial to be the \"entry level\" option, even though it may be less prestigious, because if you're not, someone else will be, and they will squash you against the ceiling. This, in turn, implies that prestige can be a danger sign.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What concept did the author learn from his experiences at Viaweb and Y Combinator, and how did he perceive prestige in this context?\n",
      "Answer: The author learned from his experiences at Viaweb and Y Combinator that customs continue to constrain people long after the restrictions that caused them have disappeared. This was true for both the venture capital industry and essay writing, where traditional practices persisted despite changes in the underlying conditions. He realized that independent-minded individuals, those less influenced by custom, have an advantage in fields affected by rapid change, as they are more likely to adapt to new circumstances and break away from obsolete customs.\n",
      "\n",
      "In terms of prestige, the author seemed to perceive it as something that could be challenged and redefined. For instance, he chose the color orange for Y Combinator partly because no other venture capital firm used it, suggesting a desire to differentiate himself from the traditional, staid colors associated with prestige in the industry. Additionally, the author named Y Combinator after a concept from the lambda calculus, the Y combinator, which could be seen as a way of associating prestige with intellectual curiosity and innovation rather than traditional markers of status.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What was the primary focus of painting students at RISD, according to the text?\n",
      "Answer: The primary focus of painting students at RISD, as per the text, was to express themselves, often by trying to develop a distinctive signature style. This style is akin to a 'schtick' in show business, serving as a unique identifier for their work. However, there were also students who were more earnest and focused on improving their drawing skills, having been talented in this area in high school.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What led the author to drop out of RISD in 1993 and what opportunity did they receive after dropping out?\n",
      "Answer: The author dropped out of RISD in 1993 because they felt they were essentially teaching themselves to paint and could do so for free. They didn't see the need to continue paying for education they felt they weren't receiving. After dropping out, the author received an opportunity from their college friend, Nancy Parmet. Nancy offered them a rent-controlled apartment in a building her mother owned in New York. The rent was not much more than what the author was currently paying, and New York was known for being a hub for artists, making it an attractive offer.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What was the author's motivation for deciding to write another book on Lisp, and what were his hopes for the outcome?\n",
      "Answer: The author decided to write a book on Lisp hacking as he found Lisp interesting in its own right, beyond its association with AI, which was the main reason people cared about it at the time. He had experienced a setback in his original plans and was looking for something to salvage from the situation. Despite having limited knowledge about Lisp hacking when he started writing the book, he saw it as an opportunity to learn more about the subject. He hoped that writing the book would not only help him deepen his understanding of Lisp hacking but also result in a valuable resource for others interested in the topic. The book, titled \"On Lisp,\" was eventually published in 1993, although much of it was written during his time in graduate school.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What was the initial startup idea of the author and Robert Morris, and why did it fail to gain traction?\n",
      "Answer: The initial startup idea of the author and Robert Morris was to put art galleries online. They wrote software to generate websites for galleries and tried to sign up galleries for this service. However, this idea failed to gain traction because art galleries, especially the fancy ones, were not interested in being online. This was not how they preferred to sell their art. Despite trying to give away their service for free, they struggled to find any galleries willing to use it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What was the initial plan for the software to build online stores and why was it considered an alarming prospect?\n",
      "Answer: The initial plan for the software to build online stores was to create normal desktop software, which in those days meant Windows software. This was considered an alarming prospect because neither of the individuals involved knew how to write Windows software or wanted to learn. They were more comfortable in the Unix world. However, they decided to at least try writing a prototype store builder on Unix.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What was the significant breakthrough that the authors achieved on August 12, and why was it important in the context of software development at the time?\n",
      "Answer: The text does not provide information about a significant breakthrough achieved by the author on August 12. It discusses the author's experience with Lisp, creating a new dialect called Arc, and the discovery of an online audience after posting a talk on their website, which gained significant attention. Additionally, the author shares their early experiences with computers, from mainframes to microcomputers, and their interest in programming. However, no specific event or achievement related to August 12 is mentioned.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What was the initial deal that the author and Robert made with a certain individual in exchange for legal work and business advice?\n",
      "Answer: The initial deal that the author and Robert made with a certain individual in exchange for legal work and business advice was to give him 10% of their company.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: Who were the two programmers recommended by Robert to work on the project, and what was one unique characteristic of each of them?\n",
      "Answer: The context does not provide information about two programmers recommended by Robert for a project, nor their unique characteristics. The context discusses the personal experiences of an individual with writing, programming, and using early computers, including the IBM 1401 and microcomputers like the Heathkit and TRS-80.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: In what year did the business open with 6 stores and what was the initial concern about their timing?\n",
      "Answer: The business opened with 6 stores in January 1996. Initially, there was a concern that they might have been late to the market, but in retrospect, they realized they were almost fatally early. Despite the buzz about ecommerce in the press, there wasn't a significant demand for online stores at that time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What was the pricing strategy for Viaweb and why was it set at that level?\n",
      "Answer: The pricing strategy for Viaweb was to charge $100 a month for a small store and $300 a month for a large one. This was done with the intention of making the software easy to use and inexpensive, similar to being the Microsoft Word of ecommerce software. The founders were determined to be competitive in the market and wanted to avoid being like Interleaf. Interestingly, the low price was not a result of a strategic insight, but rather due to their lack of knowledge about what businesses typically paid for such services. To them, $300 a month seemed like a substantial amount. Despite this, the low price turned out to be a significant attraction for customers and a constant source of frustration for competitors.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What was the author's initial attitude towards 'business' and how did it change over time?\n",
      "Answer: The context does not provide explicit information about the author's initial attitude towards 'business'. However, it is clear that the author had a significant shift in perspective regarding the publishing of essays, which can be seen as a type of business. Initially, the author seemed to accept the traditional norms and constraints of essay publishing, which involved going through editors and established channels. This changed when the author realized the potential of the internet for publishing essays, leading to a newfound excitement and commitment to writing and publishing essays online. This shift could be interpreted as a change in the author's attitude towards the business of essay publishing, moving from acceptance of traditional methods to embracing innovative, digital ones.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What was the author's primary reason for hiring more employees, despite advising a startup to do the opposite?\n",
      "Answer: The context does not provide information about the author hiring more employees or advising a startup to do the opposite. It primarily discusses the author's experiences with their startup, Viaweb, and their approach to gaining users, learning about retail, and the importance of growth rate. It also mentions the author's involvement with a program called YC, which invests in startups and provides a supportive community for founders. However, there is no mention of the author hiring more employees or advising a startup to do the opposite.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What was the author's motivation for buying a yellow 1998 VW GTI and how did he perceive its luxury?\n",
      "Answer: The author bought a yellow 1998 VW GTI as a result of the financial windfall he received when Yahoo bought his company. This purchase was made in anticipation of his move to California. He perceived the car's leather seats as the most luxurious item he owned at the time, highlighting a significant shift in his lifestyle from his previous grad student days.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: Why did the author decide to leave his job at Yahoo, and what was his boss's reaction to this decision?\n",
      "Answer: The author decided to leave his job at Yahoo after his first chunk of options vested, as he felt he had achieved his goal of becoming financially secure so that he could pursue his passion for painting. His boss at Yahoo had a long conversation with him about his plans, initially appearing interested in the author's artistic pursuits. However, the author later realized that his boss was likely concerned about the potential loss of talent and intellectual property, as the author was leaving behind options worth approximately $2 million a month, leading his boss to suspect he might be starting a new startup and potentially taking employees with him. This was during the height of the Internet Bubble, and Yahoo was at its epicenter.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What was the narrator's initial solution to overcome his lack of energy and ambition for painting, and why didn't it work as expected?\n",
      "Answer: The narrator's initial solution to overcome his lack of energy and ambition for painting was to attend a prestigious institution, the Accademia, in the hopes of learning and being inspired. However, this didn't work as expected because the students and faculty had an arrangement where neither party was required to teach or learn anything, despite maintaining the outward appearance of a 19th-century atelier. This resulted in an unproductive environment where the narrator was one of the few actually painting the nude model, while others spent their time chatting or trying to imitate things from American art magazines.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What new technique did the author experiment with in their painting process, and what did it involve?\n",
      "Answer: The author experimented with painting still lives, a technique that was different from painting people. This new approach involved painting tiny still life objects on leftover scraps of canvas in their bedroom at night. The subject of these paintings couldn't move, unlike people who can't sit for more than about 15 minutes at a time and don't sit very still. This allowed the author to take their time and focus on the intricate details of the inanimate objects.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What was the initial name given to the kind of company Viaweb was, which was later replaced by 'software as a service'?\n",
      "Answer: The initial name given to the kind of company Viaweb was, which was later replaced by 'software as a service', was 'Aspra'.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What was the original name that the speaker considered for his new company before deciding on 'Aspra' and why did he ultimately change his mind about running the company?\n",
      "Answer: The original name the speaker considered for his new company was a reflection of the then-current term for companies like Viaweb, an \"application service provider,\" or ASP. Thus, he named the new company Aspra. However, halfway through the summer, he realized he didn't want to run a company, especially not a big one, which it seemed this would have to be. He had only started his previous company, Viaweb, because he needed the money. Now that he didn't need money anymore, he decided to build a subset of his vision that could be done as an open source project instead of running a full-fledged company.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What programming language did the author work on at the end of the summer and what did he call this new dialect?\n",
      "Answer: The author worked on a new dialect of Lisp at the end of the summer. He called this new dialect Arc.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What did the author realize would be a 'turning point' in his career, according to the provided context?\n",
      "Answer: The author realized that the turning point in his career was when he started publishing essays online. This was a significant revelation for him, as he understood that the internet provided a new platform for publishing essays, which was previously a domain restricted to a select few in the print era. He decided from then on that no matter what else he did, he would always write essays and publish them online.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What was the title of the book that O'Reilly reprinted a collection of the author's essays as, and which essay did it take its name from?\n",
      "Answer: The context does not provide the title of the book that O'Reilly reprinted a collection of the author's essays as, and neither does it mention which essay it took its name from.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What was the unique concept behind the party hosted at the speaker's house in October 2003, and who initiated this idea?\n",
      "Answer: The unique concept behind the party hosted at the speaker's house in October 2003 was that three separate hosts would each invite their own friends to the same party. This arrangement ensured that for every guest, two thirds of the other guests would be people they didn't know but would probably like, thus creating an environment conducive to meeting new people and expanding social circles. The idea for this unique party concept was initiated by the speaker's friend, Maria Daniels, who was one of the regular attendees at the speaker's Thursday dinners.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What was the speaker's motivation for giving a talk at the Harvard Computer Society, and what was the main topic of his presentation?\n",
      "Answer: The context does not provide information on the speaker's motivation for giving a talk at the Harvard Computer Society, nor does it mention the main topic of his presentation. However, it can be inferred that the speaker has a strong interest in AI and Lisp, and has written a book on Lisp hacking, so it's possible these topics could be related to his presentation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What event triggered the speaker's decision to start their own investment firm and who did they plan to involve in this venture?\n",
      "Answer: The speaker decided to start their own investment firm after growing frustrated with the slow decision-making process of a Boston VC firm where his friend Jessica had interviewed for a marketing job. This decision was also influenced by his previous plans to get involved in angel investing and his desire to collaborate with Robert and Trevor on new projects. He planned to fund the firm himself, have Jessica quit her job to work for it, and bring Robert and Trevor on as partners.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What was the unique approach of YC in comparison to traditional VC firms and angel investors, as described in the text?\n",
      "Answer: YC's unique approach was a combination of several factors. Unlike traditional VC firms that only made large investments and didn't provide much assistance to founders, YC focused on making smaller seed investments and offering comprehensive support to startups. This included helping with tasks like getting incorporated, setting up bylaws, and other administrative work that founders might find challenging.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another distinctive feature of YC was its batch model. Instead of investing in startups individually throughout the year, YC funded a group of startups all at once, twice a year. Following this, they would spend three months focusing intensively on helping these startups grow and develop. This model was initially adopted as a way for YC to gain experience as investors, but it turned out to be a successful strategy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Furthermore, YC was not organized as a traditional fund. It was initially funded with the founders' own money, which allowed them to keep all the returns, a fact that often went unnoticed but was significant to professional investors.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lastly, YC's branding was also unique in its field. They chose a name from a concept in the lambda calculus, the Y combinator, and picked orange as their color, which was uncommon among VC firms at the time. These choices reflected YC's desire to stand out and differentiate itself from traditional VC firms.\n",

    "[Embeddings](https://arize.com/blog-course/embeddings-meaning-examples-and-how-to-compute/) encode the meaning of retrieved documents and user queries. Not only are they an essential part of RAG systems, but they are immensely useful for understanding and debugging LLM application performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Phoenix takes the high-dimensional embeddings from your RAG application, reduces their dimensionality, and clusters them into semantically meaningful groups of data. You can then select the metric of your choice (e.g. hallucinations or QA correctness) to visually inspect the performance of your application and surface problematic clusters. The advantage of this approach is that it provides metrics on granular yet meaningful subsets of your data that help you analyze local, not merely global, performance across a dataset. It's also helpful for gaining intuition around what kind of queries your LLM application is struggling to answer."
