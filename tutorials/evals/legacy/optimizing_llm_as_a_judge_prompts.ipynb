    "**What is LLM as a Judge?**\n",
    "\n",
    "An LLM as a Judge refers to using an LLM as a tool for evaluating and scoring responses based on predefined criteria. The LLM functions as a \"judge,\" making decisions and assigning scores based on the input it receives. Some common use cases include evaluations for hallucinations, user frustration, and summarization quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why Do We Want to Refine These Prompts?**\n",
    "\n",
    "While LLMs are powerful tools for evaluation, their performance can be inconsistent. Factors like ambiguity in the prompt, biases in the model, or a lack of clear guidelines can lead to unreliable results. By fine-tuning your LLM prompts, you can improve the model's consistency, fairness, and accuracy, ensuring it delivers more reliable evaluations.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, you will:\n",
    "- Generate an LLM as a Judge evaluation prompt and test it against a datset\n",
    "- Learn about various optimization techniques to improve the template, measuring accuracy at each step using Phoenix evaluations\n",
    "- Understand how to apply these techniques together for better evaluation across your specific use cases\n",
