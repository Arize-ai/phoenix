These reactions occur in the stroma , the fluid-filled area of a chloroplast outside of the thylakoid membranes. These reactions take the light-dependent reactions and perform further chemical processes on them. There are three phases to the light-independent reactions, collectively called the Calvin cycle : carbon fixation, reduction reactions, and ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate (RuBP) regeneration. Despite its name, this process occurs only when light is available. Plants do not carry out the Calvin cycle by night. They, instead, release sucrose into the phloem from their starch reserves. This process happens when light is available independent of the kind of photosynthesis ( C3 carbon fixation , C4 carbon fixation , and Crassulacean Acid Metabolism ); CAM plants store malic acid in their vacuoles every night and release it by day in order to make this process work.   \n",
                            "3  The Philistine cities of Gaza, Ashdod, Ashkelon, Ekron, and Gath The Philistines (, , , or ; , Plištim), Pleshet or Peleset, were a people who as part of the Sea Peoples appeared in the southern coastal area of Canaan at the beginning of the Iron Age (circa 1175 BC), most probably from the Aegean region. According to the Bible , they ruled the five city-states (the \"Philistine Pentapolis\") of Gaza , Ashkelon , Ashdod , Ekron and Gath , from Wadi Gaza in the south to the Yarqon River in the north, but with no fixed border to the east. The Bible paints them as the Kingdom of Israel 's most dangerous enemy. Originating somewhere in the Aegean , their population was around 25,000 in the 12th century BC, rising to a peak of 30,000 in the 11th century BC, of which the Aegean element was not more than half the total, and perhaps much less. Nothing is known for certain about the original language or languages of the Philistines, however they were not part of the Semitic Canaanite population. There is some limited evidence in favour of the assumption that the Philistines were Indo-European-speakers either from Greece and/or Luwian speakers from the coast of Asia Minor . Philistine-related words found in the Bible are not Semitic, and can in some cases, with reservations, be traced back to Proto-Indo-European roots. By the beginning of the 1st Millennium BCE they had adopted the general Canaanite language of the region.   \n",

It is often offered to American high school students when they are in the 10th, 11th and 12th grade, though anyone eligible for enlistment may take it.

These reactions occur in the stroma , the fluid-filled area of a chloroplast outside of the thylakoid membranes. THESE REACTIONS TAKE THE LIGHT-DEPENDENT REACTIONS AND PERFORM FURTHER CHEMICAL PROCESSES ON THEM. There are three phases to the light-independent reactions, collectively called the Calvin cycle : carbon fixation, reduction reactions, and ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate (RuBP) regeneration. Despite its name, this process occurs only when light is available. Plants do not carry out the Calvin cycle by night. They, instead, release sucrose into the phloem from their starch reserves. This process happens when light is available independent of the kind of photosynthesis ( C3 carbon fixation , C4 carbon fixation , and Crassulacean Acid Metabolism ); CAM plants store malic acid in their vacuoles every night and release it by day in order to make this process work.   \n",
                            "3  The Philistine cities of Gaza, Ashdod, Ashkelon, Ekron, and Gath The Philistines (, , , or ; , Plištim), Pleshet or Peleset, were a people who as part of the Sea Peoples appeared in the southern coastal area of Canaan at the beginning of the Iron Age (circa 1175 BC), most probably from the Aegean region. According to the Bible , they ruled the five city-states (the \"Philistine Pentapolis\") of Gaza , Ashkelon , Ashdod , Ekron and Gath , from Wadi Gaza in the south to the Yarqon River in the north, but with no fixed border to the east. The Bible paints them as the Kingdom of Israel 's most dangerous enemy. Originating somewhere in the Aegean , their population was around 25,000 in the 12th century BC, rising to a peak of 30,000 in the 11th century BC, of which the Aegean element was not more than half the total, and perhaps much less. Nothing is known for certain about the original language or languages of the Philistines, however they were not part of the Semitic Canaanite population. There is some limited evidence in favour of the assumption that the Philistines were Indo-European-speakers either from Greece and/or Luwian speakers from the coast of Asia Minor . Philistine-related words found in the Bible are not Semitic, and can in some cases, with reservations, be traced back to Proto-Indo-European roots. By the beginning of the 1st Millennium BCE they had adopted the general Canaanite language of the region.   \n",

They compete in the annual Rugby Championship , along with southern-hemisphere counterparts Argentina , Australia and New Zealand . They have won this championship on three occasions in sixteen years. They are currently ranked second in the world by the International Rugby Board , and were named 2008 World Team of the Year at the Laureus World Sports Awards. Although South Africa was instrumental in the creation of the Rugby World Cup competition, the Springboks did not compete in the first two World Cups in 1987 and 1991 because of anti-apartheid sporting boycotts of South Africa. The team made its World Cup debut in 1995 , when the newly democratic South Africa hosted the tournament. The Springboks then defeated the All Blacks 15–12 in the final , which is now remembered as one of the greatest moments in South Africa's sporting history, and a watershed moment in the post-Apartheid nation-building process. South Africa regained their title as champions 12 years later, when they defeated England 15–6 in the 2007 final . As a result of the 2007 World Cup tournament the Springboks were promoted to first place in the IRB World Rankings, a position they held until July the following year when New Zealand regained the top spot. The Springboks play in green and gold jerseys, and their emblems are the Springbok and the Protea . The side has been playing international rugby since 1891, when a British Isles side toured the nation, playing South Africa in their first Test on 30 July. South Africa was coached by Jake White , who led the Boks to the 2007 World Cup title, announcing his resignation effectively from the end of 2007. His replacement's ( Peter de Villiers ) contract expired in 2011, following a 11–9 defeat to Australia in the Rugby World Cup quarter-final, who then stated he would not be signing a new deal. The previous captain was John Smit , who before he retired in 2011 played hooker for most of his career, although he has also been a prop , mainly in 2008 and 2009. Due to Smit being unavailable for the November 2010 Tests after surgery, lock Victor Matfield took Smit's place as captain for that tour. The current captain is Jean de Villiers .\n",

Since a sequence of operations can be readily changed, the computer can solve more than one kind of problem. Conventionally, a computer consists of at least one processing element, typically a central processing unit (CPU) and some form of memory . The processing element carries out arithmetic and logic operations, and a sequencing and control unit that can change the order of operations based on stored information. Peripheral devices allow information to be retrieved from an external source, and the result of operations saved and retrieved. The first electronic digital computers were developed between 1940 and 1945 in the United Kingdom and United States. Originally they were the size of a large room, consuming as much power as several hundred modern personal computers (PCs). In this era mechanical analog computers were used for military applications. Modern computers based on integrated circuits are millions to billions of times more capable than the early machines, and occupy a fraction of the space. Simple computers are small enough to fit into mobile devices , and mobile computers can be powered by small batteries . Personal computers in their various forms are icons of the Information Age and are what most people think of as “computers.” However, the embedded computers found in many devices from MP3 players to fighter aircraft and from toys to industrial robots are the most numerous.\n",

The term \"effective\" is used because the shielding effect of negatively charged electrons prevents higher orbital electrons from experiencing the full nuclear charge by the repelling effect of inner-layer electrons. The effective nuclear charge experienced by the outer shell electron is also called the core charge .

Globalization , which had accelerated after the early 1990s fall of communism , continued to be a force in the 2000s. The growth of the Internet was one of the prime contributors to globalization during the decade, making it possible for people to interact with other people, express ideas, introduce others to different cultures and backgrounds, use goods and services, sell and buy online, research and learn about things, along with experiencing the world without having to leave home. The institutions, linkages and technologies that emerged or were redefined earlier would subsequently in this decade benefit many countries, in particular China and India. However, in other parts of the world such progress failed to address ongoing struggles with modernity , most notably characterized by the rise of al-Qaeda and other Islamist groups. The September 11 attacks in 2001 led to the United States, United Kingdom, Spain, Canada and other nations invading Afghanistan , as well as implementing various anti-terrorist measures at home and abroad in what was known as the War on Terror . The European Union saw further integration and expansion throughout much of Europe. The economic growth of the 2000s had considerable environmental consequences, raised demand for diminishing energy resources , and was still shown to be vulnerable as demonstrated during the Global Financial Crisis of the late 2000s.\n",

Crosby was drafted first overall by the Penguins out of the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League (QMJHL). During his two-year major junior career with the Rimouski Océanic , he earned back-to-back CHL Player of the Year awards and led his club to the 2005 Memorial Cup final. Nicknamed \" The Next One \", he was one of the most highly regarded draft picks in hockey history, leading many to refer to the 2005 Draft Lottery as the \"Sidney Crosby Sweepstakes\". In his first NHL season , Crosby finished sixth in league scoring with 102 points (39 goals, 63 assists) and was a runner-up for the Calder Memorial Trophy (won by Alexander Ovechkin ). By his second season , he led the NHL with 120 points (36 goals, 84 assists) to capture the Art Ross Trophy , becoming the youngest player and the only teenager to win a scoring title in any major North American sports league . That same season, Crosby also won the Hart Memorial Trophy as the Professional Hockey Writers Association 's choice for most valuable player and the Lester B. Pearson Award as the NHL Players Association 's choice for most outstanding player, becoming the seventh player in NHL history to earn all three awards in one year. Crosby started the 2007–08 season with the team's captaincy and subsequently led them to the 2008 Stanley Cup Finals , where they were defeated by the Detroit Red Wings in six games. The Penguins returned to the Finals against Detroit the following year and won in seven games; Crosby became the youngest captain in NHL history to win the Stanley Cup . In the 2009–10 season , Crosby scored a career-high 51 goals, tying him with Steven Stamkos for the Rocket Richard Trophy as the league-leader; with 58 assists, he totaled 109 points, second in the NHL. During the off-season, Crosby received the Mark Messier Leadership Award . In 2010–11 , Crosby sustained a concussion as a result of hits to the head in back-to-back games. The injury left him sidelined for ten and a half months. However, after playing eight games in the 2011–12 season , Crosby's concussion-like symptoms returned in December 2011, and he did not return until mid-March 2012. Internationally, Crosby has represented Canada in numerous tournaments for the country's junior and men's teams . After competing in the 2003 U-18 Junior World Cup , he represented Canada in back-to-back IIHF World U20 Championships , winning silver in 2004 and gold in 2005 . At the 2006 IIHF World Championship , he led the tournament in scoring, while also earning Top Forward and All-Star Team honours. Four years later, Crosby was named to Team Canada for the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver . Playing the United States in the gold medal game, he scored the game-winning goal in overtime .\n",

The literary history of Gilgamesh begins with five independent Sumerian poems about 'Bilgamesh' (Sumerian for Gilgamesh ), king of Uruk . Four of these were used as source material for a combined epic in Akkadian . This first combined epic, known as the \"Old Babylonian\" version, dates to the 18th century BC and is titled after its incipit , Shūtur eli sharrī (\"Surpassing All Other Kings\"). Only a few fragments of it have survived. The later \"Standard Babylonian\" version dates from the 13th to the 10th centuries BC and bears the incipit Sha naqba īmuru (\"He who Saw the Deep\"). Fragments of approximately two thirds of this longer, twelve-tablet version have been recovered. Some of the best copies were discovered in the library ruins of the 7th-century BC Assyrian king Ashurbanipal . The story centers on a friendship between Gilgamesh and Enkidu . Enkidu is a wild man created by the gods as Gilgamesh's equal to distract him from oppressing the people of Uruk . Together, they journey to the Cedar Mountain to defeat Humbaba , its monstrous guardian. Later they kill the Bull of Heaven, which the goddess Ishtar sends to punish Gilgamesh for spurning her advances. As a punishment for these actions, the gods sentence Enkidu to death. The second half of the epic focuses on Gilgamesh's distress at Enkidu's death, and his quest for immortality. In order to learn the secret of eternal life, Gilgamesh undertakes a long and perilous journey. He learns that \"The life that you are seeking you will never find. When the gods created man they allotted to him death, but life they retained in their own keeping.\" This quote was originally attributed to Siduri in the Old Babylonian version of the epic, and then attributed to the immortal flood hero Utnapishtim in the Akkadian version of the epic. Nevertheless, Gilgamesh's fame lived on after his death, because of his great building projects, and his account of what Utnapishtim told him happened during the flood. The story has been translated into many different languages, and Gilgamesh has since become adapted in works of popular fiction .</td>\n",

The Braves are a member of the Eastern Division of Major League Baseball 's National League . The Braves have played in Turner Field since 1997. The \"Braves\" name, which was first used in 1912, originates from a term for a Native American warrior. They are nicknamed \"the Bravos\", and often referred to as \" America's Team \" in reference to the team's games being broadcast on the nationally available TBS from the 1970s until 2007, gaining a wide fanbase. From 1991 to 2005 the Braves were one of the most successful franchises in baseball, winning division titles an unprecedented 14 consecutive times in that period (omitting the strike-shortened 1994 season in which there were no official division champions). The Braves won the NL West 1991–93 and the NL East 1995–2005, and returned to the playoffs as the National League Wild Card in 2010. The Braves advanced to the World Series five times in the 1990s, winning the title in 1995. Since their debut in the National League in 1876, the franchise has won 16 divisional titles, 17 National League pennants , as well as three World Series championships—in 1914 as the Boston Braves, in 1957 as the Milwaukee Braves, and in 1995 in Atlanta. The Braves are the only MLB franchise to have won the World Series in three different home cities. The club is one of the National League's two remaining charter franchises (the other being the Chicago Cubs ) and was founded in Boston, Massachusetts , in 1871 as the Boston Red Stockings (not to be confused with the American League's Boston Red Sox ). They are considered \"the oldest continuously playing team in major North American sports .\" There is an argument as to who is actually older because although the Cubs are a full season \"older\" (formed as the Chicago White Stockings in 1870) Chicago lost two seasons to the Great Chicago Fire , thus the Braves have played more consecutive seasons. After various name changes (such as the Boston Beaneaters), the team operated as the Boston Braves for most of the first half of the 20th century. In 1953, the team moved to Milwaukee, Wisconsin and became the Milwaukee Braves, followed by the move to Atlanta in 1966. The team's tenure in Atlanta is famous for Hank Aaron breaking Babe Ruth 's career home run record in 1974, though the majority of Aaron's home runs were hit while the team was in Milwaukee . His record stood until 2007, when San Francisco left fielder Barry Bonds broke the record.</td>\n",

The religion grew to account for 96.1% of the national population at the time of the Federation of Australia in 1901. The Anglican Church of Australia (formerly known as the Church of England in Australia ) remained the largest denomination until 1986, when it was surpassed by the Roman Catholic Church in Australia . Post-war multiculturalism and a decline in religious observance among some sections of the population have diversified the demographics of religion in Australia . Of the roughly 61% identifying as Christian in 2011, the largest denominations were either Roman Catholic (25%) or Anglican (17%), with the third largest denomination being the 5% affiliated with the Uniting Church in Australia . Post-war immigration has grown the numbers belonging to churches like the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of Australia and there are large and growing Pentecostal groups, such as Sydney's Hillsong Church . The festivals of Easter and Christmas are public holidays in Australia. Around a quarter of students attend church schools and Christian organisations are leading non-government providers of health and welfare services through organisations like Catholic Health Australia , Anglicare , UnitingCare Australia , the Salvation Army and St Vincent de Paul Society .

The literary history of Gilgamesh begins with five independent Sumerian poems about 'Bilgamesh' (Sumerian for Gilgamesh ), king of Uruk . Four of these were used as source material for a combined epic in Akkadian . This first combined epic, known as the \"Old Babylonian\" version, dates to the 18th century BC and is titled after its incipit , Shūtur eli sharrī (\"Surpassing All Other Kings\"). Only a few fragments of it have survived. The later \"Standard Babylonian\" version dates from the 13th to the 10th centuries BC and bears the incipit Sha naqba īmuru (\"He who Saw the Deep\"). Fragments of approximately two thirds of this longer, twelve-tablet version have been recovered. Some of the best copies were discovered in the library ruins of the 7th-century BC Assyrian king Ashurbanipal . The story centers on a friendship between Gilgamesh and Enkidu . Enkidu is a wild man created by the gods as Gilgamesh's equal to distract him from oppressing the people of Uruk . Together, they journey to the Cedar Mountain to defeat Humbaba , its monstrous guardian. Later they kill the Bull of Heaven, which the goddess Ishtar sends to punish Gilgamesh for spurning her advances. As a punishment for these actions, the gods sentence Enkidu to death. The second half of the epic focuses on Gilgamesh's distress at Enkidu's death, and his quest for immortality. In order to learn the secret of eternal life, Gilgamesh undertakes a long and perilous journey. He learns that \"The life that you are seeking you will never find. When the gods created man they allotted to him death, but life they retained in their own keeping.\" This quote was originally attributed to Siduri in the Old Babylonian version of the epic, and then attributed to the immortal flood hero Utnapishtim in the Akkadian version of the epic. Nevertheless, Gilgamesh's fame lived on after his death, because of his great building projects, and his account of what Utnapishtim told him happened during the flood. The story has been translated into many different languages, and Gilgamesh has since become adapted in works of popular fiction .   \n",
                            "1  The Atlanta Braves are a professional baseball team based in Atlanta . The Braves are a member of the Eastern Division of Major League Baseball 's National League . The Braves have played in Turner Field since 1997. The \"Braves\" name, which was first used in 1912, originates from a term for a Native American warrior. They are nicknamed \"the Bravos\", and often referred to as \" America's Team \" in reference to the team's games being broadcast on the nationally available TBS from the 1970s until 2007, gaining a wide fanbase. From 1991 to 2005 the Braves were one of the most successful franchises in baseball, winning division titles an unprecedented 14 consecutive times in that period (omitting the strike-shortened 1994 season in which there were no official division champions). The Braves won the NL West 1991–93 and the NL East 1995–2005, and returned to the playoffs as the National League Wild Card in 2010. The Braves advanced to the World Series five times in the 1990s, winning the title in 1995. Since their debut in the National League in 1876, the franchise has won 16 divisional titles, 17 National League pennants , as well as three World Series championships—in 1914 as the Boston Braves, in 1957 as the Milwaukee Braves, and in 1995 in Atlanta. The Braves are the only MLB franchise to have won the World Series in three different home cities. The club is one of the National League's two remaining charter franchises (the other being the Chicago Cubs ) and was founded in Boston, Massachusetts , in 1871 as the Boston Red Stockings (not to be confused with the American League's Boston Red Sox ). They are considered \"the oldest continuously playing team in major North American sports .\" There is an argument as to who is actually older because although the Cubs are a full season \"older\" (formed as the Chicago White Stockings in 1870) Chicago lost two seasons to the Great Chicago Fire , thus the Braves have played more consecutive seasons. After various name changes (such as the Boston Beaneaters), the team operated as the Boston Braves for most of the first half of the 20th century. In 1953, the team moved to Milwaukee, Wisconsin and became the Milwaukee Braves, followed by the move to Atlanta in 1966. The team's tenure in Atlanta is famous for Hank Aaron breaking Babe Ruth 's career home run record in 1974, though the majority of Aaron's home runs were hit while the team was in Milwaukee . His record stood until 2007, when San Francisco left fielder Barry Bonds broke the record.   \n",

In the 2011 Census, 61.1% of Australians were listed as Christian . Australia has no official state religion and the Australian Constitution protects freedom of religion . The presence of Christianity in Australia began with the arrival of the First Fleet of British convicts in 1788. The religion grew to account for 96.1% of the national population at the time of the Federation of Australia in 1901. The Anglican Church of Australia (formerly known as the Church of England in Australia ) remained the largest denomination until 1986, when it was surpassed by the Roman Catholic Church in Australia . Post-war multiculturalism and a decline in religious observance among some sections of the population have diversified the demographics of religion in Australia . Of the roughly 61% identifying as Christian in 2011, the largest denominations were either Roman Catholic (25%) or Anglican (17%), with the third largest denomination being the 5% affiliated with the Uniting Church in Australia . Post-war immigration has grown the numbers belonging to churches like the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of Australia and there are large and growing Pentecostal groups, such as Sydney's Hillsong Church . The festivals of Easter and Christmas are public holidays in Australia. Around a quarter of students attend church schools and Christian organisations are leading non-government providers of health and welfare services through organisations like Catholic Health Australia , Anglicare , UnitingCare Australia , the Salvation Army and St Vincent de Paul Society . Historically significant Australian Christians have included Rev Dr John Dunmore Lang , Saint Mary MacKillop , Catherine Helen Spence , Pastor David Unaipon , the Reverend John Flynn and Pastor Sir Doug Nicholls . High profile contemporary Australian Christians include: Tim Costello Baptist minister and current CEO of World Vision Australia , Frank Brennan , Jesuit human rights lawyer, Cardinal George Pell , Catholic Archbishop of Sydney , Phillip Aspinall the current Anglican Primate and Archbishop of Brisbane , Kevin Rudd , former Labor Prime Minister , and Tony Abbott , leader for the Federal Opposition Liberal Party .   \n",

One of the wood-engraved illustrations by Gustave Doré . The Rime of the Ancient Mariner (originally The Rime of the Ancyent Marinere) is the longest major poem by the English poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge , written in 1797–98 and published in 1798 in the first edition of Lyrical Ballads . Modern editions use a later revised version printed in 1817 that featured a gloss . Along with other poems in Lyrical Ballads, it was a signal shift to modern poetry and the beginning of British Romantic literature .   \n",

A prime meridian and its opposite in a 360°-system, the 180th meridian (at 180° longitude), form a great circle . This great circle divides the sphere, e.g. the Earth , into two hemispheres . If one uses directions of East and West from a defined prime meridian, then they can be called Eastern Hemisphere and Western Hemisphere . Gerardus Mercator in his Atlas Cosmographicae (1595) uses a prime meridian somewhere close to 25°W , passing just to the west of Santa Maria Island in the Atlantic . His 180th meridian runs along the Strait of Anián (Bering Strait) A prime meridian is ultimately arbitrary, unlike an equator , which is determined by the axis of rotation—and various conventions have been used or advocated in different regions and throughout history.   \n",
