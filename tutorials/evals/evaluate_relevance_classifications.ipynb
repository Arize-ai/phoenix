    "Arize provides tooling to evaluate LLM applications, including tools to determine the relevance or irrelevance of documents retrieved by retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) applications. This relevance is then used to measure the quality of each retrieval using ranking metrics such as precision@k. In order to determine whether each retrieved document is relevant or irrelevant to the corresponding query, our approach is straightforward: ask an LLM.\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this notebook is:\n",
    "\n",
    "- to evaluate the performance of an LLM-assisted approach to relevance classification against information retrieval datasets with ground-truth relevance labels,\n",
    "- to provide an experimental framework for users to iterate and improve on the default classification template.\n",

       "3  The Philistine cities of Gaza, Ashdod, Ashkelon, Ekron, and Gath The Philistines (, , , or ; , Plištim), Pleshet or Peleset, were a people who as part of the Sea Peoples appeared in the southern coastal area of Canaan at the beginning of the Iron Age (circa 1175 BC), most probably from the Aegean region. According to the Bible , they ruled the five city-states (the \"Philistine Pentapolis\") of Gaza , Ashkelon , Ashdod , Ekron and Gath , from Wadi Gaza in the south to the Yarqon River in the north, but with no fixed border to the east. The Bible paints them as the Kingdom of Israel 's most dangerous enemy. Originating somewhere in the Aegean , their population was around 25,000 in the 12th century BC, rising to a peak of 30,000 in the 11th century BC, of which the Aegean element was not more than half the total, and perhaps much less. Nothing is known for certain about the original language or languages of the Philistines, however they were not part of the Semitic Canaanite population. There is some limited evidence in favour of the assumption that the Philistines were Indo-European-speakers either from Greece and/or Luwian speakers from the coast of Asia Minor . Philistine-related words found in the Bible are not Semitic, and can in some cases, with reservations, be traced back to Proto-Indo-European roots. By the beginning of the 1st Millennium BCE they had adopted the general Canaanite language of the region.   \n",

It is often offered to American high school students when they are in the 10th, 11th and 12th grade, though anyone eligible for enlistment may take it. Although the test is administered by the military, it is not (and never has been) a requirement that a test-taker with a qualifying score enlist in the armed forces.   \n",

There is some limited evidence in favour of the assumption that the Philistines were Indo-European-speakers either from Greece and/or Luwian speakers from the coast of Asia Minor . Philistine-related words found in the Bible are not Semitic, and can in some cases, with reservations, be traced back to Proto-Indo-European roots. By the beginning of the 1st Millennium BCE they had adopted the general Canaanite language of the region.   \n",

It is often offered to American high school students when they are in the 10th, 11th and 12th grade, though anyone eligible for enlistment may take it. Although the test is administered by the military, it is not (and never has been) a requirement that a test-taker with a qualifying score enlist in the armed forces.   \n",

       "      <td>Scooby-Doo is an American animated cartoon franchise , comprising several animated television series produced from 1969 to the present day. The original series, Scooby-Doo, Where Are You! , was created for Hanna-Barbera Productions by writers Joe Ruby and Ken Spears in 1969. This Saturday morning cartoon series featured four teenagers— Fred Jones , Daphne Blake , Velma Dinkley , and Norville \"Shaggy\" Rogers — and their talking brown Great Dane dog named Scooby-Doo , who solve mysteries involving supposedly supernatural creatures through a series of antics and missteps. Following the success of the original series, Hanna-Barbera and its successor Warner Bros. Animation have produced numerous follow-up and spin-off animated series and several related works, including television specials and telefilms, a line of direct-to-video films, and two Warner Bros. –produced theatrical feature films. Some versions of Scooby-Doo feature different variations on the show's supernatural theme, and include characters such as Scooby's cousin Scooby-Dum and nephew Scrappy-Doo in addition to or instead of some of the original characters. Scooby-Doo was originally broadcast on CBS from 1969 to 1976, when it moved to ABC . ABC aired the show until canceling it in 1986, and presented a spin-off featuring the characters as children, A Pup Named Scooby-Doo , from 1988 until 1991. Two new Scooby-Doo series, What's New, Scooby-Doo? and Shaggy and Scooby-Doo Get a a Clue!]], aired as part of Kids WB on The WB network and its successor, The CW network, from 2002 until 2008. The most recent Scooby-Doo series, Scooby-Doo! Mystery Incorporated , aired on Cartoon Network from 2010 to 2013. Repeats of the various Scooby-Doo series are broadcast frequently on Cartoon Network and Boomerang in the United States and other countries.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Tampa () is a city in the U.S. state of Florida . It serves as the county seat for Hillsborough County and is located on the west coast of Florida, on Tampa Bay near the Gulf of Mexico . The population of Tampa in 2011 was 346,037. The current location of Tampa was once inhabited by indigenous peoples of the Safety Harbor culture , most notably the Tocobaga and the Pohoy , who lived along the shores of Tampa Bay . It was briefly explored by Spanish explorers in the early 16th century, but there were no permanent American or European settlements within today's city limits until after the United States had acquired Florida from Spain in 1819. In 1824, the United States Army established a frontier outpost called Fort Brooke at the mouth of the Hillsborough River , near the site of today's Tampa Convention Center . The first civilian residents were pioneers who settled near the fort for protection from the nearby Seminole population. The town grew slowly until the 1880s, when railroad links, the discovery of phosphate, and the arrival of the cigar industry jump-started Tampa's development and helped it to grow into an important city by the early 1900s. Today, Tampa is a part of the metropolitan area most commonly referred to as the Tampa Bay Area . For U.S. Census purposes, Tampa is part of the Tampa-St. Petersburg-Clearwater, Florida Metropolitan Statistical Area . The four-county area is composed of roughly 2.7 million residents, making it the second largest metropolitan statistical area (MSA) in the state, and the fourth largest in the Southeastern United States , behind Miami , Washington, D.C. , and Atlanta . The Greater Tampa Bay area has just over 4 million residents and generally includes the Tampa and Sarasota metro areas. The Tampa Bay Partnership and U.S. Census data showed an average annual growth of 2.47 percent, or a gain of approximately 97,000 residents per year. Between 2000 and 2006, the Greater Tampa Bay Market experienced a combined growth rate of 14.8 percent, growing from 3.4 million to 3.9 million and hitting the 4 million people mark on April 1, 2007. A 2012 estimate shows the Tampa Bay area population to have 4,310,524 people and a 2017 projection of 4,536,854 people. Tampa has a number of sports teams, such as the Tampa Bay Buccaneers of the National Football League , the Tampa Bay Lightning of the National Hockey League , and the Tampa Bay Storm of the Arena Football League . The Tampa Bay Rays in Major League Baseball and the Tampa Bay Rowdies of the North American Soccer League play their home games in neighboring St. Petersburg, Florida . In 2008, Tampa was ranked as the 5th best outdoor city by Forbes . A 2004 survey by the NYU newspaper Washington Square News ranked Tampa as a top city for \"twenty-somethings.\" Tampa is now ranked as a \"Gamma\" world city by Loughborough University . According to Loughborough, Tampa ranks alongside other world cities such as Phoenix , Santo Domingo , and Osaka . In recent years Tampa has seen a notable upsurge in high-market demand from consumers, signaling more wealth concentrated in the area. Tampa hosted the 2012 Republican National Convention .</td>\n",

       "      <td>An invoice or bill is a commercial document issued by a seller to a buyer , indicating the products , quantities, and agreed prices for products or services the seller has provided the buyer. An invoice indicates the sale transaction only. Payment terms are independent of the invoice and are negotiated by the buyer and the seller. Payment terms are usually included on the invoice. The buyer could have already paid for the products or services listed on the invoice. Buyer can also have a maximum number of days in which to pay for these goods and is sometimes offered a discount if paid before the due date. In the rental industry, an invoice must include a specific reference to the duration of the time being billed, so in addition to quantity, price and discount the invoicing amount is also based on duration. Generally each line of a rental invoice will refer to the actual hours, days, weeks, months, etc., being billed. From the point of view of a seller, an invoice is a sales invoice. From the point of view of a buyer, an invoice is a purchase invoice. The document indicates the buyer and seller, but the term invoice indicates money is owed or owing. In English, the context of the term invoice is usually used to clarify its meaning, such as \"We sent them an invoice\" (they owe us money) or \"We received an invoice from them\" (we owe them money).</td>\n",

       "      <td>Track and field is a sport comprising various competitive athletic contests based on running , jumping , and throwing. The name of the sport derives from the competition venue: a stadium with an oval running track around a grass field. The throwing and jumping events generally take place in the central enclosed area. Track and field falls under the umbrella sport of athletics , which also includes road running , cross country running , and race walking . The two most prestigious international track and field competitions are held under the banner of athletics: the athletics competition at the Olympic Games and the IAAF World Championships in Athletics . The International Association of Athletics Federations is the international governing body for track and field. Track and field events are generally individual sports with athletes challenging each other to decide a single victor. The racing events are won by the athlete with the fastest time, while the jumping and throwing events are won by the athlete who has achieved the greatest distance or height in the contest. The running events are categorised as sprints , middle and long-distance events , relays , and hurdling . Regular jumping events include long jump , triple jump , high jump and pole vault , while the most common throwing events are shot put , javelin , discus and hammer . There are also \"combined events\", such as heptathlon and decathlon , in which athletes compete in a number of the above events. Records are kept of the best performances in specific events, at world and national levels, right down to a personal level. However, if athletes are deemed to have violated the event's rules or regulations, they are disqualified from the competition and their marks are erased. In North America, the term track and field may be used to refer to athletics in general, rather than specifically track and field events.</td>\n",

Some versions of Scooby-Doo feature different variations on the show's supernatural theme, and include characters such as Scooby's cousin Scooby-Dum and nephew Scrappy-Doo in addition to or instead of some of the original characters. Scooby-Doo was originally broadcast on CBS from 1969 to 1976, when it moved to ABC . ABC aired the show until canceling it in 1986, and presented a spin-off featuring the characters as children, A Pup Named Scooby-Doo , from 1988 until 1991. Two new Scooby-Doo series, What's New, Scooby-Doo? and Shaggy and Scooby-Doo Get a a Clue!]], aired as part of Kids WB on The WB network and its successor, The CW network, from 2002 until 2008. The most recent Scooby-Doo series, Scooby-Doo! Mystery Incorporated , aired on Cartoon Network from 2010 to 2013. Repeats of the various Scooby-Doo series are broadcast frequently on Cartoon Network and Boomerang in the United States and other countries.   \n",
       "2  Tampa () is a city in the U.S. state of Florida . It serves as the county seat for Hillsborough County and is located on the west coast of Florida, on Tampa Bay near the Gulf of Mexico . The population of Tampa in 2011 was 346,037. The current location of Tampa was once inhabited by indigenous peoples of the Safety Harbor culture , most notably the Tocobaga and the Pohoy , who lived along the shores of Tampa Bay . It was briefly explored by Spanish explorers in the early 16th century, but there were no permanent American or European settlements within today's city limits until after the United States had acquired Florida from Spain in 1819. In 1824, the United States Army established a frontier outpost called Fort Brooke at the mouth of the Hillsborough River , near the site of today's Tampa Convention Center . The first civilian residents were pioneers who settled near the fort for protection from the nearby Seminole population. The town grew slowly until the 1880s, when railroad links, the discovery of phosphate, and the arrival of the cigar industry jump-started Tampa's development and helped it to grow into an important city by the early 1900s. Today, Tampa is a part of the metropolitan area most commonly referred to as the Tampa Bay Area . For U.S. Census purposes, Tampa is part of the Tampa-St. Petersburg-Clearwater, Florida Metropolitan Statistical Area . The four-county area is composed of roughly 2.7 million residents, making it the second largest metropolitan statistical area (MSA) in the state, and the fourth largest in the Southeastern United States , behind Miami , Washington, D.C. , and Atlanta . The Greater Tampa Bay area has just over 4 million residents and generally includes the Tampa and Sarasota metro areas.

An invoice indicates the sale transaction only. Payment terms are independent of the invoice and are negotiated by the buyer and the seller. Payment terms are usually included on the invoice. The buyer could have already paid for the products or services listed on the invoice. Buyer can also have a maximum number of days in which to pay for these goods and is sometimes offered a discount if paid before the due date. In the rental industry, an invoice must include a specific reference to the duration of the time being billed, so in addition to quantity, price and discount the invoicing amount is also based on duration. Generally each line of a rental invoice will refer to the actual hours, days, weeks, months, etc., being billed. From the point of view of a seller, an invoice is a sales invoice. From the point of view of a buyer, an invoice is a purchase invoice. The document indicates the buyer and seller, but the term invoice indicates money is owed or owing. In English, the context of the term invoice is usually used to clarify its meaning, such as \"We sent them an invoice\" (they owe us money) or \"We received an invoice from them\" (we owe them money).   \n",

The name of the sport derives from the competition venue: a stadium with an oval running track around a grass field. The throwing and jumping events generally take place in the central enclosed area. Track and field falls under the umbrella sport of athletics , which also includes road running , cross country running , and race walking . The two most prestigious international track and field competitions are held under the banner of athletics: the athletics competition at the Olympic Games and the IAAF World Championships in Athletics . The International Association of Athletics Federations is the international governing body for track and field. Track and field events are generally individual sports with athletes challenging each other to decide a single victor. The racing events are won by the athlete with the fastest time, while the jumping and throwing events are won by the athlete who has achieved the greatest distance or height in the contest. The running events are categorised as sprints , middle and long-distance events , relays , and hurdling . Regular jumping events include long jump , triple jump , high jump and pole vault , while the most common throwing events are shot put , javelin , discus and hammer . There are also \"combined events\", such as heptathlon and decathlon , in which athletes compete in a number of the above events. Records are kept of the best performances in specific events, at world and national levels, right down to a personal level. However, if athletes are deemed to have violated the event's rules or regulations, they are disqualified from the competition and their marks are erased. In North America, the term track and field may be used to refer to athletics in general, rather than specifically track and field events.   \n",
