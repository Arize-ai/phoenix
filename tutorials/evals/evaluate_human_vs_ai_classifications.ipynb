                            "4  To upload a ranking model using the SDK, you would typically follow these steps:\\n\\n1. Install the SDK in your Python environment if you haven't already done so.\\n2. Import the SDK into your Python script where you plan to upload the model data.\\n3. Configure the SDK with your Arize API key and space key to authenticate your requests.\\n4. Define your model schema, including fields like `rank`, `prediction_score`, and `prediction_group_id`.\\n5. Use the SDK functions to log model predictions, actuals, and any additional metadata related to your ranking model.\\n6. Once your data is prepared, call the appropriate function provided by the SDK to send your ranking model data to the Arize platform.\\n\\nThe exact function names and parameters may vary based on the SDK version and the specifics of the ranking model you are working with. You should refer to the SDK documentation for detailed instructions on logging model schemas and sending data to the Arize platform.   \n",

Configure the SDK with your Arize API key and space key to authenticate your requests.\\n4. Define your model schema, including fields like `rank`, `prediction_score`, and `prediction_group_id`.\\n5. Use the SDK functions to log model predictions, actuals, and any additional metadata related to your ranking model.\\n6. Once your data is prepared, call the appropriate function provided by the SDK to send your ranking model data to the Arize platform.\\n\\nThe exact function names and parameters may vary based on the SDK version and the specifics of the ranking model you are working with.

Install the SDK in your Python environment if you haven't already done so.\\n2. Import the SDK into your Python script where you plan to upload the model data.\\n3. Configure the SDK with your Arize API key and space key to authenticate your requests.\\n4. Define your model schema, including fields like `rank`, `prediction_score`, and `prediction_group_id`.\\n5. Use the SDK functions to log model predictions, actuals, and any additional metadata related to your ranking model.\\n6. Once your data is prepared, call the appropriate function provided by the SDK to send your ranking model data to the Arize platform.\\n\\nThe exact function names and parameters may vary based on the SDK version and the specifics of the ranking model you are working with. You should refer to the SDK documentation for detailed instructions on logging model schemas and sending data to the Arize platform.   \n",
