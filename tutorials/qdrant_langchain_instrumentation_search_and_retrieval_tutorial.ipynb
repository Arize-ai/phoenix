Look for regular intervals at which your data\\'s characteristics change.\\n\\n2. **Adjusting Baselines**: As suggested in the \"Change Your Baseline\" section, you might need to adjust your baseline to account for seasonality. For instance, comparing current production data against a baseline from a similar seasonal period in the past rather than using a fixed historical baseline.\\n\\n3. **Custom Alerts**: Configure custom alerts that account for expected seasonal variations. This might involve setting different thresholds for different times of the year or adjusting the sensitivity of your drift detection mechanisms during known periods of seasonal change.\\n\\n4. **Periodic Review**: Regularly review and adjust your thresholds and baselines to ensure they remain relevant as your model continues to operate over time. This is particularly important for models exposed to seasonal trends, as the impact of these trends on your data and model performance might evolve.\\n\\n5. **Proxy Metrics**: In cases where you have delayed actuals, as mentioned in the \"Delayed Actuals\" section, use proxy metrics that might be less sensitive to seasonal effects to evaluate model performance in the interim.\\n\\nIf your specific platform or tool supports more advanced configurations for handling seasonality, it would be advisable to consult the relevant documentation or reach out to support for guidance tailored to your situation.'}\n",
