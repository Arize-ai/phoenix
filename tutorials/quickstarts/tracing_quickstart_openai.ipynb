    "Tracing is a powerful tool for understanding the behavior of your LLM application. Phoenix has best-in-class tracing, regardless of what framework you use, and has first-class instrumentation for a variety of frameworks (LlamaIndex, LangChain, DSPy),  SDKs (OpenAI, Bedrock, Mistral, Vertex), and Languages (Python, Javascript). You can also manually instrument your application using the OpenTelemetry SDK.\n",
