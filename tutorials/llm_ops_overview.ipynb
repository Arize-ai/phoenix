    "Building software with LLMs, or any machine learning model, is [fundamentally different](https://karpathy.medium.com/software-2-0-a64152b37c35). Rather than compiling source code into binary to run a series of commands, we need to navigate datasets, embeddings, prompts, and parameter weights to generate consistent accurate results. LLM outputs are probabilistic and therefore don't produce the same deterministic outcome every time.\n",

    "The complexity that is involved in building an LLM application is why observability is so important. Observability is the ability to understand the internal state of a system by examining its inputs and outputs. Each step of the response generation process needs to be monitored, evaluated and tuned to provide the best possible experience. Not only that, certain tradeoffs might need to be made to optimize for speed, cost, or accuracy. In the context of LLM applications, we need to be able to understand the internal state of the system by examining telemetry data such as LLM Traces.\n"

    "Using Phoenix's embedding projection feature, we can now view the query embeddings in a 3D space. What you are looking at is a point-cloud where each point represents a query. When embeddings are projected into a lower dimensional space, UMAP preserves the semantic distance that the embeddings encode. This means that the points that are closer together are more similar. This allows us to see patterns in the data and understand how our application is performing in various clusters. If you click through the clusters, you will see clusters of queries that are significantly farther away from the knowledge base. This means that the knowledge base does not contain enough information to answer the user's question (In this case, the document chunks don't contain any information about pricing. Can you find this cluster?). \n",

Phoenix's embedding view supports embeddings for text, images, and video so a most forms of unstructured data can be analyzed.\n",

    "Last but not least, Phoenix can draw the connections between queries and the document chunks. This allows you to see which document chunks are being retrieved for each query and to visualize the semantic distance between them. \n",
