    "Building software with LLMs, or any machine learning model, is [fundamentally different](https://karpathy.medium.com/software-2-0-a64152b37c35). Rather than compiling source code into binary to run a series of commands, we need to navigate datasets, embeddings, prompts, and parameter weights to generate consistent accurate results. LLM outputs are probabilistic and therefore don't produce the same deterministic outcome every time.\n"

    "\n",
    "LLM Traces and Observability lets us understand the system from the outside, by letting us ask questions about that system without knowing its inner workings. Furthermore, it allows us to easily troubleshoot and handle novel problems (i.e. “unknown unknowns”), and helps us answer the question, “Why is this happening?”\n",
    "\n",
    "LLM Traces are designed to be a category of telemetry data that is used to understand the execution of LLMs and the surrounding application context such as retrieval from vector stores and the usage of external tools such as search engines or APIs. It lets you understand the inner workings of the individual steps your application takes wile also giving you visibility into how your system is running and performing as a whole.\n",
    "\n",
    "Traces are made up of a sequence of `spans`. A span represents a unit of work or operation (think a span of time). It tracks specific operations that a request makes, painting a picture of what happened during the time in which that operation was executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "LLM Tracing supports the following span kinds:\n",

    "<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Arize-ai/phoenix-assets/main/images/blog/span_kinds.png\" width=\"1100\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "A trace is a collection of related spans that together represent a complete workflow, such as a single request to an application or one run of an agent.\n",
    "\n",
    "By capturing the building blocks of your application while it's running, Phoenix can provide a more complete picture of the inner workings of your application. To illustrate this, let's look at an example LLM application and inspect it's traces.\n"
