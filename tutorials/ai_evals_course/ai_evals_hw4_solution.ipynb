    "## 🎯 Assignment Overview\n",
    "In this assignment, you’ll build and evaluate a BM25-based RAG system for recipes, generate synthetic user queries with llm_generate, and trace everything in Phoenix for visibility and analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Workflow\n",
    "- 🧰 Setup — Install deps, set env vars, and import libs.\n",
    "\n",
    "- 📥 Load & structure data — Read RAW_recipes.csv, normalize fields (title, ingredients, steps, raw text).\n",
    "\n",
    "- 🔤 Tokenize & index — Use a number-preserving tokenizer (keeps 375 F, 9x13) and build/load a BM25 index.\n",
    "\n",
    "- 🧪 Generate synthetic queries — Use llm_generate to create realistic, technical cooking questions (+ validation & dedupe).\n",
    "\n",
    "- ☁️ Upload dataset to Phoenix — Map to input (query) and output (salient_fact) and upload as a Phoenix Dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "- 🔎 Run retriever with tracing — For each query, call retrieve_bm25() (decorated) to emit rag.query → retrieval.bm25 spans.\n",
    "\n",
    "- 🧪 Experiments — Run a Phoenix Experiment (Recall@1/3/5, MRR) and compare runs.\n",
    "\n",
    "- 💾 Save results — Persist per-query outputs & summary to JSON for offline review.\n",
    "\n",
    "- 📊 Inspect in Phoenix — View spans, top-k documents, evaluation chips, and experiment summaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Core Task: “Can the retriever surface the correct recipe?”\n",
    "You’ll evaluate whether the ground-truth recipe (the one that the synthetic question depends on) appears in the top-k results—especially top-1/3/5."

weddings, christenings or anniversaries. the pastry used in this pie recipe is hot water crust pastry, which is a direct descendant of \"coffer\" paste that was used to encase and protect meat whilst it cooked centuries ago – the pies then being called “coffyns”! the pastry is shaped by hand whilst it is still warm, and is excellent for using with intricate pie moulds - the technique is known as \"hand raised\" and pies made this way are called \"raised pies\". the pastry is easy to make, but must be kept warm whilst you are using it - i keep mine warm over a pan of simmering water. this pastry is excellent for all types of traditional raised pies, such as game pies, pork pies and veal and ham pies.
