    "# HW4: Recipe RAG — BM25, Synthetic Queries, Phoenix\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🎯 Assignment Overview\n",
    "In this assignment, you’ll build and evaluate a BM25-based RAG system for recipes, generate synthetic user queries with llm_generate, and trace everything in Phoenix for visibility and analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Workflow\n",
    "- 🧰 Setup — Install deps, set env vars, and import libs.\n",
    "\n",
    "- 📥 Load & structure data — Read RAW_recipes.csv, normalize fields (title, ingredients, steps, raw text).\n",
    "\n",
    "- 🔤 Tokenize & index — Use a number-preserving tokenizer (keeps 375 F, 9x13) and build/load a BM25 index.\n",
    "\n",
    "- 🧪 Generate synthetic queries — Use llm_generate to create realistic, technical cooking questions (+ validation & dedupe).\n",
    "\n",
    "- ☁️ Upload dataset to Phoenix — Map to input (query) and output (salient_fact) and upload as a Phoenix Dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "- 🔎 Run retriever with tracing — For each query, call retrieve_bm25() (decorated) to emit rag.query → retrieval.bm25 spans.\n",
    "\n",
    "- 🧪 Experiments — Run a Phoenix Experiment (Recall@1/3/5, MRR) and compare runs.\n",
    "\n",
    "- 💾 Save results — Persist per-query outputs & summary to JSON for offline review.\n",
    "\n",
    "- 📊 Inspect in Phoenix — View spans, top-k documents, evaluation chips, and experiment summaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Core Task: “Can the retriever surface the correct recipe?”\n",
    "You’ll evaluate whether the ground-truth recipe (the one that the synthetic question depends on) appears in the top-k results—especially top-1/3/5."

food cake mix\\neggs\\nbuttermilk\\nred food coloring\\npeppermint candies\\nred candy melts\\npeppermint oil\\nfondant\\nfood coloring\\ncandy sprinkles\\nicing\\nwhite frosting\\n\\nSteps:\\nbefore you begin , you will need to gather the following tools: nonstick baking spray , silicone popsicle mold , toothpicks , butter knife or fondant tools , wax paper , thin black food safe marker , food safe brushes , 2 piping bags , small round piping\\nif you\\'d like to make the white icing from scratch please see the buttercream recipe with my mermaid cake pops\\nto make the cake pops , preheat the oven to 350&deg\\nf spray your silicone molds generously with nonstick baking spray , and place them on a baking sheet\\nin a large mixing bowl add the cake mix , eggs , buttermilk , and red food coloring , and whisk together for 2 minutes\\nfold in the crushed peppermint candy\\ntransfer the batter to either a piping bag or large zip top bag , and cut a small corner off\\npipe the batter into each popsicle mold filling a little less than halfway , then insert the sticks\\nbake for 12- 15 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean\\nallow the cakes to cool for 15 minutes in the mold before gently removing and transferring to a cooling rack to cool completely\\nmelt 1 bag of red candy melts at a time in a small heatproof jar\\nstart with heating them for 1 minute , in the microwave , at 50% power , and then decrease the time to 30 second intervals , at 50% power , stirring between each interval until the melts are smooth\\nif they are still lumpy after completely melting you can stir in either paramount crystals or vegetable oil 1 teaspoon at a time until you reach a smooth consistency\\nstir in 1 / 8 teaspoon peppermint candy oil\\ncarefully dip each cake pop into the candy shell allowing the excess to drip off , before placing them on a piece of wax paper to set\\ni like to dip each cake pop twice for an even and smooth coating\\ntime to turn them into nutcrackers ! roll your different shades of fondant out to 1 / 8 inch thick\\nuse either a fondant tool or butter knife to cut a rectangle out of the fondant so that it\\'ll cover about half of the cake pop\\nsmooth it over the top half of your cake pop , using a little water , if needed , to help it to stick\\nrepeat with the rest of the skin tones and cake pops\\nto make the decorations simpler i am breaking them up into as many little steps as possible , starting with the helmets\\nuse a toothpick as a guide to section off the rounded top of the fondant covered pop for the top of the helmut , and paint it with the edible gold paint\\nroll out the rest of the light fondant , and cut an oval shape , almost like an eye with the pointed corners , for the front of each helmet\\nattach below the section you just painted\\npaint this piece gold as well\\nattach 3 of the gold dragees while the paint is still tacky - 1 to the top middle of the front you just attached , and 1 on either side where the front of the helmet meets the side of the cake pop\\nroll a tiny ball of the black fondant between your fingers to form a small log\\nplace it down on wax paper , and use 2 fingers to carefully squeeze the sides in to form the shape of the tassels for the tops of the hats\\nattach to the top of every helmet\\nattach a small round piping\\nyou can add sideways \"v\" designs on either side of the sprinkle in the middle to complete the helmets\\nnext , i like to use a toothpick to carefully outline the sleeves as well as the design in the middle of each jacket\\nmy jacket and helmet designs were inspired by the nutcracker\\'s costume in the nutcracker and the four realms , please see my images for guidance on replicating the look , or feel free to create your own design\\nnow for my favorite part of all , the hair ! fit your second piping bag with the open star\\nbeginning on either side of the rim of the hat , pipe and release 2-3 lines of frosting to look like the hair coming out from under the helmet\\nthen , pipe and swirl the frosting to create the curls , repeat on both sides of the face\\nuse the black decorating icing and small round\\ni like to change the faces for each cake pop to give them a bit more personality\\nyou can add tiny highlights to any of the open eyes with the white frosting\\nfor the nutcrackers with only a mustache i added noses and mouths , but i skipped this step if i was going to give them beards\\nadd mustaches to all of the characters by beginning right below the nose and piping one side of the mustache , then the other , with the white frosting\\nwait until the jackets are complete to add the beards\\nyou can also use the pink decorating icing , and a small round piping\\npaint the design in the middle of the jacket\\nthen use the black decorating icing to pipe around it , as well as to pipe the outline for each sleeve\\npipe the sleeve designs as i did , or get creative with your own\\nwait at least 15 minutes for the black icing to set a little before using a thin brush to paint the gold over it\\nadd 2 gold dragees for buttons\\nadd the hands to each nutcracker using the same skin tone fondant as you did for the top of the cake pop\\njust roll 2 little balls of the fondant and use a little water to attach them at the bottom of each sleeve\\nnow is the time to add your beards if you\\'d like\\ni created the cute nutcracker teeth using a little white fondant shaped like a semi circle , and i drew the teeth with the food marker before adding the mouth just below the mustache\\nfor a fancy final touch i piped a little more of the white frosting across the bottom of each cake pop and sprinkled them with extra crushed peppermint\\nnow you have an army of cute
