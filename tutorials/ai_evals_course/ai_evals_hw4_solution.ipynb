    "## üéØ Assignment Overview\n",
    "In this assignment, you‚Äôll build and evaluate a BM25-based RAG system for recipes, generate synthetic user queries with llm_generate, and trace everything in Phoenix for visibility and analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Workflow\n",
    "- üß∞ Setup ‚Äî Install deps, set env vars, and import libs.\n",
    "\n",
    "- üì• Load & structure data ‚Äî Read RAW_recipes.csv, normalize fields (title, ingredients, steps, raw text).\n",
    "\n",
    "- üî§ Tokenize & index ‚Äî Use a number-preserving tokenizer (keeps 375 F, 9x13) and build/load a BM25 index.\n",
    "\n",
    "- üß™ Generate synthetic queries ‚Äî Use llm_generate to create realistic, technical cooking questions (+ validation & dedupe).\n",
    "\n",
    "- ‚òÅÔ∏è Upload dataset to Phoenix ‚Äî Map to input (query) and output (salient_fact) and upload as a Phoenix Dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "- üîé Run retriever with tracing ‚Äî For each query, call retrieve_bm25() (decorated) to emit rag.query ‚Üí retrieval.bm25 spans.\n",
    "\n",
    "- üß™ Experiments ‚Äî Run a Phoenix Experiment (Recall@1/3/5, MRR) and compare runs.\n",
    "\n",
    "- üíæ Save results ‚Äî Persist per-query outputs & summary to JSON for offline review.\n",
    "\n",
    "- üìä Inspect in Phoenix ‚Äî View spans, top-k documents, evaluation chips, and experiment summaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Core Task: ‚ÄúCan the retriever surface the correct recipe?‚Äù\n",
    "You‚Äôll evaluate whether the ground-truth recipe (the one that the synthetic question depends on) appears in the top-k results‚Äîespecially top-1/3/5."

hints to avoid trouble at this stage: the balloon should be slightly under inflated and the temperature of the candy melts being too warm can cause the balloon to pop and splatter difficult to clean candy all over you and your kitchen\\ni can\\'t guarantee this won\\'t happen anyway , which is why i mentioned you should blow up several and make your peace with disaster before it happens\\nlayer the balloon several times and keep frozen until ready to use\\nwhen desired shape is achieved punch small hole in balloon and slowly begin to remove using your fingers to separate the balloon from the frozen candy\\nif any large pieces of your pumpkin core break , simply heat the edges and put it back where it broke from\\nkeep remaining candy melts to brush on final cake to create delicious seal\\nfor pumpkin cake- pre-heat oven to 350\\nin a large bowl , mix flour , baking powder , baking soda , salt and cinnamon , set aside\\nin stand mixer , combine 4 cups white sugar\\n2 1 / 2 cups

coloring and taste to ensure the flavor is to your liking\\nremove cake crescents from fridge and candy core dome from freezer and frost and apply in two layers\\ninitial layer should start horizontal and the last layer should be vertical\\nkeep in mind pumpkins are somewhat irregular , so don\\'t worry too much about imperfections\\nrefrigerate often to ensure cake is structurally sound and never work in a warm kitchen\\nonce built , frost with remaining buttercream and pipe stripes from top to bottom and blend for added dimension and flavor\\nseal with leftover candy melts and finalize by painting additional shadows and highlights\\nuse a flame-heated blade to carve the jack-o-lantern\\ncut a small mouse hole in the back and light with either a candle or a plug-in light\\nthis cake has no supports , so know it must be kept cold as it could collapse if left at room
