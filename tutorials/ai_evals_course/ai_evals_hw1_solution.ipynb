    "1. **ü§ñ Write an Effective System Prompt**: Create a well-crafted system prompt that defines our recipe bot's personality, capabilities, and output format\n",
    "2. **üìä Expand Our Query Dataset**: Add diverse test queries to evaluate different aspects of our chatbot's performance  \n",
    "3. **üî¨ Set up Phoenix Testing**: Use Phoenix to test and improve our prompt.\n",
