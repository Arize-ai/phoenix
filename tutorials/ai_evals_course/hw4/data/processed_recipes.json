    "steps": [
      "first of all: these are not typical directions , but you need to know about needed equipment before attempting this cake",
      "here it is:",
      "8-inch round cake pan , at least 2 inches high",
      "8-inch round cake pan with removable bottom or 8-inch springform pan",
      "untreated heavy-duty jelly-roll pans",
      "rubber spatula , offset spatula , and flexible 8-inch metal icing spatula",
      "decorating turntable , lazy susan , or inverted round cake pan",
      "ridged plastic shelf liner , freezer paper , or 055 mylar",
      "parchment paper and waxed paper",
      "making the cake:",
      "position a rack in the lower third of the oven or just below the center of the oven and preheat the oven to 350f fit the bottom of an 8-inch round cake pan , one at least 2 inches high , with parchment paper and set aside",
      "pour the clarified butter into a 1-quart bowl and stir in the vanilla extract , if you're using it",
      "the butter must be hot when added to the batter , so either keep the bowl in a skillet of hot water or reheat at the last minute",
      "although the flour and cocoa were sifted before they were measured , they need to be triple-sifted together",
      "sift or sieve the flour and cocoa together 3 times , then set sifter on a plate or piece of waxed paper and return the dry ingredients to the sifter",
      "keep close at hand",
      "whisk the eggs and sugar together in a large heatproof bowl or the bowl of a heavy-duty mixer",
      "set the bowl over direct heat or in a pan of barely simmering water and heat the eggs , whisking constantly , until they are warm to the touch",
      "remove the bowl from the heat and , working with a heavy-duty mixer fitted with the whisk attachment , beat the eggs at high speed until they are cool , have tripled in volume , and hold a ribbon when the whisk is lifted",
      "sift one third of the dry ingredients over the eggs and , using a large rubber spatula , fold in gently but thoroughly",
      "when the color of the batter is almost uniform , fold in the rest of the flour-cocoa mixture",
      "spoon about 1 cup of the batter into the hot clarified butter add fold together until well blended",
      "spoon this over the batter and , using the large rubber spatula , gently fold into the batter",
      "spoon the batter into the pan: there's no need to smooth the top or rap the pan on the counter , as is sometimes done with foam-based cakes",
      "bake the cake for 25-30 minutes , or until top of the cake springs back when pressed gently",
      "transfer the pan to a rack and let the cake cool in the pan",
      "when the cake is completely cool , run a small knife around the sides of the pan to release the cake and unmold onto a rack",
      "invert right side up onto a piece of parchment paper",
      "preparing the chocolate:",
      "the chocolate is going to be spread and then scraped into ruffles from four baking pans",
      "if you don't have enough pans , you can make the ruffles in 2 batches",
      "choose heavy-duty jelly-roll pans that are neither warped nor dented , neither nonstick non treated with special coatings",
      "keep them close at hand",
      "melt the chocolate in a heatproof bowl set in a skillet of barely simmering water , in the top of a double boiler over an inch of simmering water , or in a microwave oven sat at medium power",
      "stir the chocolate regularly until it is fully melted",
      "smooth , and 115f to 120f",
      "hold the bottom of one of the baking sheets over a burner and , moving it back and forth , heat it until it is warm but not hot enough to burn your fingers",
      "put the baking pan upside down on a flat surface and pour on about 1 / 3 cup of the chocolate",
      "use an offset spatula to spread the chocolate thinly and evenly over the bottom of the baking pan: the chocolate will only be about 1 / 16 inch thick",
      "refrigerate the pan for at least 30 minutes , or for as long as several hours , depending on your schedule",
      "repeat with rest of the chocolate and the other baking pans",
      "making the ruffles:",
      "to shape the ruffles , work with one baking pan of chocolate at a time",
      "remove a pan of chocolate from the refrigerator and leave it at room temperature to warm gradually until it is pliable enough to be scraped",
      "place the baking pan on a counter in front of you , a short side braced against your body",
      "hold the end of the blade of a then , flexible 8-inch metal icing spatula in your left hand and , with your right hand , grab the blade close to the handle",
      "you should have 4 to 5 inches of blade exposed and available for ruffling",
      "using the top left corner of the pan as your staring point and imagining that corner of the pan as 12 o'clock , position your left hand in that corner , and your right at 2 o'clock",
      "press the edge of the blade against the chocolate at a very shallow angle , as if you were going to slide the spatula blade under the chocolate",
      "now slide the blade forward , moving your right hand down to 5 o'clock and then pivoting the blade to the left , all the way to the edge of the pan",
      "as your right hand is moving down , so is your left , although not as far - your left hand will move down 4 to 5 inches",
      "this is an important point - if you don't move your left hand down , you'll end up with tight curls of chocolate rather than ruffles",
      "as you scrape and ruffle the chocolate against the blade and then make the pivot , the chocolate will gather against the blade -- use your left hand to pinch the chocolate so that the ruffles form a fan and the pinched part is a little handle",
      "you've completed one ruffle",
      "as you make each ruffle , place it on a parchment or waxed paper-lined baking sheet and refrigerate",
      "when the ruffles harden , you can layer them between sheets of waxed paper",
      "make 2 more ruffles across the top of the pan , using the previously scraped area as your guide -- the left-hand corner of chocolate will be your 12 o'clock point and the cleaned-off section of the pan your edge , or end point",
      "make the next three ruffles just below",
      "then turn the pan around to get to the chocolate on the bottom and make three more",
      "with practice -- and ruffling takes lots of practice -- you'll get 9 ruffles from each pan",
      "don't worry if you get fewer at the start",
      "if , as sometimes happens , your ruffles crack or you get rolls of chocolate , not ruffles , it might be because the chocolate is too cold -- give it a few more minutes at room temperature before you try again",
      "if the chocolate melts and gets gooey next to the spatula , it's too soft and needs a minute or two more in the refrigerator",
      "when the temperature is just right -- smooth and pliable -- but you still can't get a nicely fanned ruffle , angle the blade differently as you scrape",
      "for the syrup:",
      "bring the water and sugar to the boil in a small saucepan , stirring to dissolve the sugar , and simmer for 2 to 3 minutes",
      "remove from the heat and cool",
      "add 1 / 4 cup of the eau-de-vie",
      "taste the syrup and decide if you'd like a little more of the liqueur",
      "set aside",
      "for filling and wrap",
      "beat the creme fraiche with the vanilla extract to soft peaks , then add 2 tbsp of the sugar , beating until thickened",
      "taste and add more sugar if you want it , then continue to beat until the cream just begins to stiffen",
      "cover and keep refrigerated until needed",
      "assembling the cake -- cut the cooled genoise into 3 even layers with a long serrated knife",
      "fit one layer into the bottom of a high-sided 8-inch round cake pan with a removable bottom or an 8-inch springform pan and brush the layer with syrup",
      "place the chopped chocolate in a small bowl and whisk in the boiling water until the chocolate is fully melted and smooth",
      "switch to a rubber spatula and folds 1 / 4 cup of the creme fraiche into the chocolate",
      "fold in another cup of the creme fraiche and then quickly , before it hardens , spread the chocolate creme fraiche evenly over the genoise layer in the pan",
      "moisten the second layer of genoise with syrup and set it , moistened side down , in the pan , pressing gently to level it on the chocolate creme fraiche",
      "moisten the top of the layer with some of the syrup and top with an even layer of fresh raspberries , leaving just a bit of space between each berry",
      "keep 1 perfect berry in reserve",
      "beat the remaining creme fraiche until it holds its shape",
      "spoon 1 to 2 cups of the creme fraiche over the berries and , using an offset spatula , delicately smooth the creme fraiche over and between the berries",
      "moisten the remaining layer of genoise with syrup and set it , moistened side down , into the pan , again pressing lightly to set it in place",
      "chilling the cake -- cover the cake and the remaining creme fraiche with plastic and refrigerate for at least 2 to 3 hours , or up to 24 hours",
      "run a knife around the sides of the cake , then release and remove the pan or the ring of the springform pan",
      "put the cake , still on its pan bottom , on a large piece of parchment paper and set the cake on a decorating turntable , a lazy susan , or a large inverted cake pan",
      "making the wrap -- using ridged plastic shelf liner , freezer paper , or 500 mylar , cut a strip 26 inches long and 3 / 8 inch wider than the height of the finished cake , about 3 inches",
      "place a larger piece of waxed paper on the counter in front of you --this is your drip sheet -- and put the strip on the waxed paper",
      "melt the chocolate in the top of a double boiler set over an inch of barely simmering water or in a microwave oven set at medium power , stirring chocolate once or twice until melted and smooth",
      "the chocolate should be between 115f to 120f pour the chocolate down the center of the strip , spreading it with an offset spatula across the entire strip and beyond -- let it run over a bit onto the waxed paper",
      "slip the point of a small knife under one edge of the chocolate-coated strip and grab the edges of the strip with your fingers",
      "slide your free hand under the strip and grab the other end",
      "lift the strip and fit it neatly around the cake , positioning it so that the chocolate side is against the cake",
      "press one end against the cake and leave the other end standing away from the cake at the point where it would overlap if you pressed it closed",
      "slip a small piece of waxed paper into this spot , just to hold your place",
      "assembly and finishing",
      "chilling the wrapped cake -- refrigerate the cake of at least 1 hour , until the chocolate hardens",
      "finishing the wrapped cake -- place the cake on the decorating turntable and spread the remained creme fraiche over the top , spreading it out to the edge of the band",
      "remove the chocolate ruffles from the refrigerator and , beginning at the outside edge , arrange the ruffles in a circle , planting them gently in the creme fraiche and allowing their frilly edges to extend beyond the cake's rim",
      "continue to arrange the ruffles in slightly overlapping concentric circles until the creme fraiche is covered",
      "put the reserved perfect raspberry in the center of the cake and chill the cake for about 15 minutes , until firm , before removing the plastic and serving",
      "to remove the plastic on the chocolate band , discard the waxed paper \"place keeper\" and peel away an inch of the plastic from the end of the band attached to the cake",
      "put a dollop of melted chocolate on that end to act as glue and overlap the other end of the band , pressing lightly to seal it",
      "carefully remove the plastic",
      "if the plastic sticks , put the cake back in the refrigerator for about 10 minutes , then try again",
      "to cut the cake , dip a long sharp serrated knife into hot water , wipe it dry , and cut straight down",
      "since the first piece is often difficult to remove , it's best to make it a generous , easier-to-remove slice",
      "storing -- although the parts of the cake can be made well in advance , the assembled cake should be served the day it is made"

      "make your batter",
      "preheat your oven to 350c prepare 4 six inch round , three inch deep cake pans by greasing with shortening , placing a baking paper round on the base , greasing again , and flouring",
      "i know its a lot just to prep the pan , but you will never have cake stuck clinging to your pan ever again ! worth it",
      "in a medium-size bowl , combine your egg whites , whole eggs , 1 / 2 cup of your milk , and vanilla , lemon extract , and almond extract , and whisk to combine",
      "set aside",
      "in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment , combine your cake flour , sugar , optional whole milk powder , baking powder , and salt and mix on low speed for a few minutes until combined",
      "low speed is important here so as to avoid creating a burst of flour that will get all over your hair and maybe in your eyes , it is the worst",
      "all at once , add in your butter and keep mixing to moisten your dry ingredients , about 20 seconds",
      "begin streaming in your remaining 1 1 / 2 cups milk , half a cup at a time , continuing to beat on the lowest speed",
      "when all the milk is added , raise the mixer speed to medium and continue to beat the batter for about 1 minute",
      "this process is important because it incorporates air into your batter",
      "dont worry about developing too much glutencake flour has less than regular all-purpose",
      "scrape your bowl , and then return the batter to low speed",
      "add your egg mixture in three batches , allowing each to incorporate fully before adding the next",
      "i like to beat again here on medium for about 20 seconds just to make sure the batter is totally homogenous !",
      "bake your cake",
      "divide your batter between your prepped pans and smooth the tops",
      "bake for roughly 40-50 minutes , but keep an eye on them starting at minute 30",
      "youll know theyre baked when you press down in the center of each cake and it springs back",
      "you can also insert a cake tester , and it should come out clean with at most a few crumbs clinging to it",
      "remove your cakes from the oven and allow to come to room temperature on a rack",
      "then , i like to wrap them up in plastic and put them in the fridge for at least half an hour , preferably overnight before i remove them from the pans",
      "wrap each cake individually in plastic and put it in the refrigerator for at least 3-4 hours before stacking",
      "whether in the pan or just wrapped in plastic , these cakes should rest in the fridge for at least 8 hours total before stacking",
      "make your buttercream",

    "title": "meyer lemon and navel orange marmalade",
    "description": "this is a sweet marmalade, with just a hint of bitterness. it is not strongly bitter like seville orange marmalades are, but it has just a touch of bitterness which i think sets off the sweetness nicely. i adapted this recipe from rachel saunders' method for making marmalades. the pectin in this recipe comes from the fruits themselves, which are blanched once to remove some of the bitterness, and then soaked to leach the pectin out of the rinds. you will need to use the cold plate test to determine when the marmalade is finished cooking - i have included instructions on how to do this below. you could also use valencia oranges in this recipe, if you wish. the sugar is added after the liquid has been reduced for two reasons: the peel must be cooked until it is thoroughly soft, and if the sugar is added at the beginning of the cooking it will have a hardening effect on the peel. also, adding the sugar after the liquid has been reduced produces a fresher-tasting marmalade, because the sugar does not cook for a long time and begin to caramelize. however, if you prefer a darker, more caramelized marmalade, and don't mind the rind being a bit chewy, go ahead and add the sugar at the beginning of the cooking process (i.e. the \"marmalade\" cooking process, not the \"juice\" cooking process). this is an old fashioned recipe which takes at least 2 days, due to the soaking. it is not quick, but it is delicious.",

      "navel oranges",
      "sugar",
      "lemon juice"
    ],
    "steps": [
      "day 1 , morning: take 1 / 2 a pound of the meyer lemons and cut them into eighths",
      "place these in a non-reactive saucepan where they will fit snugly in a single layer",
      "add enough cold water for the fruit to bob freely",
      "cover tightly and let rest for 8 hours at room temperature",
      "day 1 , afternoon: after 8 hours have passed , bring the pan with the meyer lemon eighths and water to a boil over high heat , then decrease the heat to medium-low",
      "cook the fruit at a lively simmer , covered , for 2 hours - the lemons will become very soft and the liquid will become slightly syrupy",
      "as the lemons cook , press down on them gently with a spoon every 30 minutes or so , adding a little more water if necessary",
      "the water level should remain consistently high enough for the fruit to remain submerged as it cooks",
      "when the lemons are finished cooking , strain their juice by pouring the hot fruit and liquid into a fine mesh strainer or jelly bag set over a medium bowl",
      "cover the whole setup with plastic wrap and let drip overnight at room temperature",
      "meanwhile , prepare the meyer lemon slices and the navel oranges",
      "to prepare the meyer lemon slices: take the remaining half pound of the meyer lemons",
      "halve them lengthwise , then cut each half into thirds",
      "take each lemon slice and pry out any seeds from it",
      "you can place these seeds in the pot with the lemon eighths and water which is currently simmering - this will add more pectin",
      "slice each meyer lemon slice thinly crosswise - how thick you slice is a personal preference",
      "i prefer to slice very thinly , making each slice 1 / 8th of an inch or less",
      "but if you like you could make your slices thicker",
      "i wouldn't recommend going much thicker than 1 / 4 of an inch",
      "place these meyer lemon slices in a stainless steel pot and cover with water , covering the slices by 1 inch",
      "bring to a boil over high heat , then decrease the heat to medium and simmer for 5 minutes",
      "drain , discarding the liquid",
      "return the lemon slices to the pot and cover with 1 inch of cold water",
      "bring to a boil over high heat , decrease the heat to medium-low , and cook at a lively simmer , covered , for 20 minutes",
      "as the fruit cooks , stir it gently every 10 minutes or so , adding a little more water if necessary",
      "the water level should stay consistently high enough for the fruit to remain submerged as it cooks",
      "after 20 minutes , remove the pan from the heat , cover tightly , and let rest overnight at room temperature",
      "to prepare the navel oranges: cut the oranges in half , squeeze the juice out of the halves into a bowl , and strain the juice",
      "place this fresh orange juice in a covered container and store in the refrigerator",
      "put the juiced orange halves in a large non-reactive kettle or stock pot and cover them with water by 1 inch",
      "bring to a boil over high heat , then decrease the heat to medium-low and cook at a lively simmer for 5 minutes",
      "drain , discarding the liquid",
      "return the orange halves to the kettle and add water to cover them by 1 inch",
      "bring to a boil over high heat , then decrease the heat to medium-low and cook , covered , at a lively simmer for 1 hour",
      "as the oranges cook , press down on them gently with a spoon every 15 minutes , adding more water if necessary",
      "the water level should stay consistently high enough for the fruit to remain submerged as it cooks",
      "after 1 hour , remove the pan from the heat , cover tightly , and let rest overnight at room temperature",
      "day 2 , morning: remove the plastic wrap from the lemon eighths and their juice and discard the lemons remaining in the strainer or jelly bag",
      "do not squeeze the bag or press down on the lemons if you want a clear jelly in your marmalade",
      "set this juice aside",
      "prepare the oranges: remove the orange halves from their cooking liquid , reserving the liquid",
      "over a large bowl , use a spoon to gently scoop the remaining flesh and membranes from the orange halves , going around each one two or three times until its interior is smooth and its rind is a uniform thickness",
      "place the flesh and membranes , along with the reserved cooking liquid , in a fine mesh strainer and let this drip while you slice the orange rinds",
      "slice each orange rind into 5 equal strips , and then cut each strip crosswise into slices",
      "again , i like to make my slices about 1 / 8th of an inch thick , but you could make yours thicker if you like",
      "set the orange rind slices aside",
      "empty the fine mesh strainer , discarding the orange flesh / membrane mixture , and set the strainer back up over the bowl containing the juice you just strained from the oranges",
      "pour the meyer lemon slices and their juice through the strainer , and let this mixture drip for about 15 minutes",
      "remove the meyer lemon slices from the strainer - do not discard - set them aside",
      "mix the combined cooked juices you have strained from the oranges and lemon slices , mixing well , and set aside",
      "mix together the reserved cooked juice from the meyer lemon eighths and the fresh orange juice",
      "add to this enough of the combined cooked juices from the meyer lemon slices and the orange rinds to make 6 cups total",
      "you will have a lot of the combined cooked juices from the meyer lemon slices and orange halves left over after you use what you need to make up the 6 cups",
      "you can just discard the leftover amount",
      "in a large preserving pan , combine the 6 cups of mixed juices , the meyer lemon slices , and the navel orange rind slices",
      "if you do not have a preserving pan , use the widest pan you have",
      "the wider the pan , the more quickly moisture will evaporate from the mixture , and this is what you want when you are making jelly , jam , or marmalade",
      "place 4 saucers or small plates in the freezer",
      "you will use these later to check the set of the marmalade",
      "bring the mixture to a boil over high heat , and cook at a rapid boil over high heat until the mixture is reduced by half , stirring occasionally",
      "it will take about 35 minutes for the mixture to reduce by half",
      "once the mixture is reduced by half , add in the strained lemon juice and the sugar , stirring well over high heat to help dissolve the sugar",
      "cook at a boil over high heat , stirring every 2 minutes or so , until the set point is reached",
      "check the set after 5 minutes of cooking",
      "to check the set: take the pot of marmalade off the heat",
      "place a drop of the marmalade mixture on one of the saucers you've kept in the freezer , & place the saucer back in the freezer for 1 minute",
      "after 1 minute , take the saucer out of the freezer and nudge the drop of jelly with your finger",
      "if it \"wrinkles\" when you nudge it with your finger it is done",
      "if the jelly is not set , continue cooking over medium-high heat , checking the set again every 5 minutes",
      "i make this marmalade using an 11 quart copper preserving pan , over highest heat on my second largest burner",
      "after the sugar has been added , it usually takes 10 minutes for the marmalade to reach the set point for me",
      "when the marmalade is set , ladle it into sterilized canning jars , leaving 1 / 4\" headspace",
      "wipe the rims of the jars with damp paper towels to remove any marmalade which got on the rims or the threads",
      "place the lids and the bands on the jars , just tightening the bands finger",
      "process in a boiling water bath for 5 minutes , then remove and let sit , undisturbed , for at least 12 hours before checking seals",
      "it is important to let them sit undisturbed for 12 hours because the sealing compound on the lids is still cooling and hardening , completing the seal",
      "while the jars cool , you will hear a \"plink\" type sound from each jar - this is the jars completing the vacuum seal as the final air escapes the jar",
      "after 12 hours have passed , remove the bands and check the lids - press down in the center of the lid",
      "if you cannot push the lid down any further , the jar is sealed",
      "if the lid \"gives\" a bit , and you can push it down , the jar did not seal",
      "you can either put the band back on the jar , and reprocess it for another 5 minutes , or you can just put it in the fridge and use it within 3 months"

paper towels ready\nplace two bowls on the counter and paper towels in bottom of the bowls\ndon't worry if the cubes of pumpkin fall apart as you do this ,\nit will eventually all go into a blender\nthe goal is to remove as much moisture as possible\ntransfer cooked pumpkin between bowls , replacing paper towels until the paper towels have soaked up a good majority of the water in the pumpkin meat\nabout 5 minutes later , and many paper towels later , you will arrive at the desired consistency\n> place this pumpkin goodness into a blender , and blend well to cut up all the strings and make it uniform in texture in the pie\nstep 3--- creating pumpkin filling: i used a blender and the pie came out better , so i'm showing publishing these instructions , but i've made the pie without the blender and it was great too !\n> keeping pumpkin puree in blender add the rest of the filling ingredients , i begin with the can of nestle sweetened and condensed milk , so there is more of a thick liquid texture for blending\nnext , 1 tbsp flour , 1 tsp ground cinnamon , 1 / 2 tsp fine salt , 1 / 2 tsp ground nutmeg , 1 / 4 tsp ground allspice\nadd brown sugar to taste after all the spices as the sugar will thicken the filling , making it difficult to blend properly\ni used 1 cup tightly packed , but the filling was very sweet\nif you don't like pies too sweet , add brown sugar to taste\nthe brown sugar also adds color that looks good once baked\ni once used white sugar , and the appearance wasn't as traditional\nthe taste that you have in your blender at this point is the taste you will have in your pie , so keep playing with it until you find a good combination\nfinally , once you are satisfied with the taste , add the eggs to the blender\nlast step--- adding filling to crust and baking pie\n> take crust from fridge and pour the filling into the crust in a circular motion until the pan is filled\ndo not over fill\njust a bit below the crust edge is perfect , even if it means wasting some of the filling\nthough the filling shouldn't be very runny , it is still a very thick liquid , so avoid letting the filling slosh onto the crust as you place the unbaked pie into the oven\nput the rack on the lowest level to avoid burning the pie and heat the pie from the top and bottom burners\nleave it to cook for about 40 minutes , checking on it to make sure it is not burning\nif crust begins to get too dark , foil the crust next time\nas it heats , toward the end , the filling will puff up\nfear not\nit will settle down again as it cools and transform into the worlds best pumpkin pie after refrigeration for a few hours\nTags:\ntime-to-make\ncourse\nmain-ingredient\ncuisine\npreparation\noccasion\nnorth-american\ndesserts\nvegetables\namerican\nfall\nholiday-event\nthanksgiving\nseasonal\nsquash\n4-hours-or-less",

    "description": "warning: this dessert is not meant to be eaten, or baked, by the faint of heart!! created by marcel desaulniers of the trellis restaurant in williamsburg, this recipe takes a big commitment to make, but the payoff is worthwhile. i have not made it yet myself, but i have eaten it...many times...and the interplay of all those rich, chocolaty flavors is divine. be forewarned that, in addition to standard kitchen equipment, you will also need an electric mixer, a 9x1 1/2 inch cake pan, and a 9x3 inch springform pan, and 9 inch cardboard cake circles. a double boiler and a pastry bag with decorating tips will make the process go smoother, but they can be improvised. if you are planning on serving this for dinner, you will want to start working on it that morning, or even better, make it a day or two before and wrap it up in the fridge. you can also mix the different layers and then set them aside over a period of several days to break it up so that it isn't quite as overwhelming. recipe from \"death by chocolate: the last word on a consuming passion\" by marcel desaulniers.",

    "title": "blueberry and meyer lemon marmalade",
    "description": "i created this recipe by combining a few different recipes, but the main inspiration came from liana krissoff and rachel saunders. the pectin in this recipe comes from the lemons, which are blanched once to remove some of the bitterness, and then soaked to leach the pectin out of the rinds. you will need to use the cold plate test to determine when the marmalade is finished cooking - i have included instructions on how to do this below. this spread makes a nice change from the usual citrus-only marmalades. it is an old fashioned recipe which takes at least 2 days, due to the soaking. it is not quick, but i feel that the outcome is worth the time spent.",

    "ingredients": [
      "meyer lemon",
      "blueberries",
      "sugar",

    ],
    "steps": [
      "day 1 , morning: take the 1 / 2 pound of lemons and cut them into eighths",
      "place these in a non-reactive saucepan where they will fit snugly in a single layer",
      "add enough cold water for the fruit to bob freely",
      "cover tightly and let rest for 8 hours at room temperature",
      "day 1 , afternoon: after 8 hours have passed , bring the pan with the lemon eighths and water to a boil over high heat , then decrease the heat to medium-low",
      "cook the fruit at a lively simmer , covered , for 2 hours - the lemons will become very soft and the liquid will become slightly syrupy",
      "as the lemons cook , press down on them gently with a spoon every 30 minutes or so , adding a little more water if necessary",
      "the water level should remain consistently high enough for the fruit to remain fully submerged as it cooks",
      "when the lemons are finished cooking , strain their juice by pouring the hot fruit and liquid into a fine mesh strainer or jelly bag set over a medium bowl",
      "cover the whole setup with plastic wrap and let drip overnight at room temperature",
      "meanwhile , prepare the meyer lemon slices",
      "to prepare the meyer lemon slices: take the pound of meyer lemons and halve them lengthwise , then cut each half into quarters",
      "take each lemon slice and pry out any seeds from it",
      "you can place these seeds in the pot with the lemon eighths and water which is currently simmering - this will add more pectin",
      "slice each meyer lemon slice thinly crosswise - how thick you slice is a personal preference",
      "i prefer to slice very thinly , making each slice 1 / 8th of an inch or less",
      "but if you like you could make your slices thicker",
      "i wouldn't recommend going much thicker than 1 / 4 of an inch",
      "place these meyer lemon slices in a stainless steel pot and cover with water , covering the slices by 1 inch",
      "bring to a boil over high heat , then decrease the heat to medium and simmer for 5 minutes",
      "drain , discarding the liquid",
      "return the lemon slices to the pot and cover with 1 inch of cold water",
      "bring to a boil over high heat , decrease the heat to medium-low , and cook at a lively simmer , covered , for 20 minutes",
      "as the fruit cooks , stir it gently every 10 minutes or so , adding a little more water if necessary",
      "the water level should stay consistently high enough for the fruit to remain submerged as it cooks",
      "after 20 minutes , remove the pan from the heat , cover tightly , and let rest overnight at room temperature",
      "day 2 , morning: remove the plastic wrap from the lemon eighths and their liquid and discard the lemons remaining in the strainer or jelly bag",
      "do not squeeze the bag or press down on the lemons if you want a clear jelly in your marmalade",
      "set this liquid aside",
      "pour the meyer lemon slices and their liquid through a fine mesh strainer , and let this mixture drip for about 15 minutes",
      "remove the meyer lemon slices from the strainer - do not discard - set them aside",
      "mix the cooked liquid you have strained from the lemon eighths and the meyer lemons , mixing well , and set aside",
      "you will need 4 1 / 2 cups of this liquid",
      "if you do not have 4 1 / 2 cups , add water to the mixture until it equals 4 1 / 2 cups",

    "description": "danish pastries are the flakiest and the most buttery of all the sweet rolls. these cinnamon rolls just melt in your mouth.this recipe takes all day to make but the results are really worth it. to make it easier you can complete the recipe through step 26 on one day, and then make the actual rolls the next day. the recipe may seem complicated but it's really not. most of the time the dough is either resting or rising. for this recipe you'll need a pastry brush and something that will allow you to evenly distribute flour over your work surface. a sifter or a shaker of some type is fine. also, you must use real butter. it can be salted or unsalted (i use salted) but do not try to substitute margarine. the recipe will not work with margarine. you'll end up with a big mess in your oven if you use margarine. also, in step #11 where it says to thoroughly flour your work surface, you need to resist the temptation to knead any more flour into the dough. the dough is suppose to be that wet. note: if you wish to measure the flour by weight rather than by volume, 3 1/4 cups flour is approximately equal to 14.33 ounces or 406 grams.",

    "description": "this is a great recipe for a 'bagel party' where everyone can choose and prep their bagel filling and topping choices. this recipe can easily be halved or doubled. we tweaked this very detailed recipe from the book 'the best bagels are made at home' by dona z. meilach. we took the stand-mixer version and simplified the instructions as well as made some other adjustments as we went along to perfect it and keep it simple. choices for different types of flavors are listed at the beginning. selections for different types of toppings are listed at the bottom of the recipe. note: it's recommended to print, read, and understand the instructions completely before beginning. onion bagels: add 2 tablespoons of dehydrated minced onion, and replace salt with onion salt. italian herb bagels: add 2 teaspoons of italian seasoning, and replace salt with onion salt.",

      "for 8 large , 12 regular , or 16",

    "description": "when i was a young kid one or other of us in turn occasionally used to be allowed to wreak havoc in the kitchen. i used to make the most mess - but the best cakes! this is a recipe i asked for from the elderly scottish pastry cook who used to live opposite. she even had me bake it one time in her kitchen - none of my siblings were so privileged - boy was i was smug about that! she used to bring over some of the most amazing goodies! i have searched and baked and bought, but never found a shortbread recipe that was anything like as good as this. fortunately my mum found a 'new' copy of her much-spattered cookbook and she gave me her old one which had this recipe manually type-written and stuck into it. nobody, but nobody!, bakes better shortbread than i occasionally treat myself to (i do share some of it!) when i bake using this recipe!!! do try this one - it's just the ultimate! :) despite the scots preference for slightly warmed shortbread i strongly urge you to wait until it's fully cold before devouring - not refrigerated cold, but ideally no warmer (or cooler really) than a cool room temperature. the instructions call for some care in the preparation but as i'm passing on the tips as they were given to me when i was between 8 to 10 years old, i'll pass them on to you rather than leave them out. - she felt they were important for best results, and the resulting shortbread proves she knew what she was talking about! the recipe is very simple and robust enough that a child can make it well, but the best results will come from taking extra special care. this recipe doesn't double well either, sadly. do especially keep that mixture cool and do it by hand not machine – it’s only a few minutes of fussing about after all! sorry to those without a set of kitchen scales, recipes in europe are almost entirely written by weight.",

    "steps": [
      "sift / sieve the flour into a bowl and add the pinch of salt",
      "put aside for the moment",
      "make some space in the fridge , if necessary , for the bowl youre about to use in case you quickly need to chill the mixture",
      "using butter , grease the baking tray well and put it aside for the moment",
      "yield for fingers is around a 7 to 8 inch square",
      "for petticoat tails it will yield a chunky 8 inch circle",
      "pre-heat the oven (gas mark 3 )",
      "put the butter into a medium-size mixing bowl and mash it with a fork until it is soft and creamy without lumps",
      "but don't let your hand heat warm it so much it starts to get runny",
      "if you do , then put the bowl complete with butter & fork into the fridge for 5 - 10 minutes to cool it , then take it out and mash quickly again until smooth and creamy with no lumps",
      "add the sugar and mix it in well , and quickly",
      "add the salted flour a very little at a time - mixing it in with the fork to start with , but do this quickly",
      "knead well",
      "i was advised: knead for several minutes , and that the longer you knead , the better the shortbread will be",
      "i usually aim for kneading for anything up to 10 minutes as i was told to , but get fed up after 7 minutes and reckon it can't make that much difference ! what is very important is: don't allow the mixture to become too warm from your body heat whilst kneading",
      "if it does , as before , put it into the fridge for a couple of minutes to chill it slightly before resuming",
      "if you do find the need to chill it , as i often do on a hot day , then do knead it for at least a minute or so before rolling it",
      "something i should add despite the copious over-instruction here: i've never owned a rolling pin until a couple of days ago",
      "i don't know if using one will affect the texture , but i always used to pat it down as best i could with my palms",
      "roll the mixture out to shape and size of the tray",
      "for fingers , roll out to about 1 / 2 inch thick or perhaps even slightly thicker",
      "for petticoat tails it needs to be a little under 1 / 2 inch thick to yield a chunky circle of about 7 to 8 inches",
      "for fingers: prick all over with a fork and put it into baking tray",
      "do try to use one that can fit exactly , or one that at least three sides of the mixture fit snugly against , as any outer edges that don't butt right up against the sides of a tray tend to get a bit over-baked",
      "for petticoat tails: using fork prongs , from the outer edge towards the centre , indent the top about a 1 / 2 inch all the way round to give it a nice crinkly edge - sort of like the teeth on a cogwheel , then prick all the way round the middle ideally rotating the fork or the pastry to give a pretty effect when cut",
      "carefully lift and support the decorated circle and place and fit snugly into the circular baking tray",
      "score lightly into eight equal segments",
      "bake until golden brown for about 45 minutes at gas mark 3",
      "do keep an eye on it ! petticoat tails seem to require a little less baking time",
      "hard to describe the colour to bake until",
      "from experience i know what colour i'm looking for - you don't really want it to be undercooked , but when it's starting get a bit dark around the edges it's probably beginning to get a bit overdone already",
      "basically cook until it's just starting to darken round the edges then get it out quick and cool it - i usually place the hot tray on a very cold surface until cool",
      "whilst still quite warm in the tray , mark across and cut into finger-shaped pieces - but leave them there in the tray , cut and together until fully cold",
      "for petticoat tails it's customary to sprinkle liberally with castor sugar",
      "sorry to be such a pedant about this recipe ! i feel a bit like a mother hen clucking about \"must do this -- \" , \"should do that -- \" :) but it is worth taking some care over as the resulting shortbread will be so good you'll be hassled to make it much more often by everyone you share the pieces with :)",
      "serving suggestion:",
      "just on its own with a nice cup of tea or coffee , but also scrumptious on a plate with and / or dunked into a generous helping of creamy cornish dairy ice-cream and strawberries , jam or fresh fruit",
      "personal",
      "i live an ultra low-fat , low-sugar , calorie-controlled lifestyle",
      "notwithstanding , i still make and eat pieces of this shortbread occasionally despite the fact that there's nothing remotely low fat , low-sugar or low calorie about it",
      "at least there's not much salt !",
      "you can make substitutions or add essences and flavourings and it'll probably work out fine but it won't be the same shortbread - it won't taste the same , it won't have the same texture , but the efforts you've put into making it will have been the same",
      "i reckon it's got to be worth trying it without substitutions first time around - you can always give the pieces that you know are much more than you really should be letting yourself scoff to friends and family who will bless you for it ! and you don't need to eat them all at once ! - they keep well in a biscuit tin or cookie jar in a cool , dark place for quite a long time",
      "i guess you could probably freeze them too",
      "additions suggestions:",
      "occasionally just for a change , right near the end of kneading i have added glace cherries , or occasionally sultanas or raisins , sometimes with and sometimes without cinnamon",
      "cherries worked ok , but wasnt crazy about the fruit",
      "you could even split the kneaded mixture in two and do half plain and half with extra stuff then nudge them together in the baking tray for baking",
      "i've never tried dessicated / flakes coconut or chunky milk / dark chocolate chips or crystallized ginger pieces perhaps with a bit of ground ginger in with the mix though i've often been tempted to - do let me know how they turn out if you do !",
      "i do know that dipping the tops from above at an angle into good quality melted real chocolate so that the bottom remains uncoated and only half of the top is coated then leaving to cool is absolute heaven on earth in the eating",
      "it also occurred to me while choco-dunking one time to add some dessicated coconut into the chocolate first - but i didn't have any - bet it's nice though !",
      "do enjoy and best wishes from england - and scotland !"

what is very important is: don't allow the mixture to become too warm from your body heat whilst kneading\nif it does , as before , put it into the fridge for a couple of minutes to chill it slightly before resuming\nif you do find the need to chill it , as i often do on a hot day , then do knead it for at least a minute or so before rolling it\nsomething i should add despite the copious over-instruction here: i've never owned a rolling pin until a couple of days ago\ni don't know if using one will affect the texture , but i always used to pat it down as best i could with my palms\nroll the mixture out to shape and size of the tray\nfor fingers , roll out to about 1 / 2 inch thick or perhaps even slightly thicker\nfor petticoat tails it needs to be a little under 1 / 2 inch thick to yield a chunky circle of about 7 to 8 inches\nfor fingers: prick all over with a fork and put it into baking tray\ndo try to use one that can fit exactly , or one that at least three sides of the mixture fit snugly against , as any outer edges that don't butt right up against the sides of a tray tend to get a bit over-baked\nfor petticoat tails: using fork prongs , from the outer edge towards the centre , indent the top about a 1 / 2 inch all the way round to give it a nice crinkly edge - sort of like the teeth on a cogwheel , then prick all the way round the middle ideally rotating the fork or the pastry to give a pretty effect when cut\ncarefully lift and support the decorated circle and place and fit snugly into the circular baking tray\nscore lightly into eight equal segments\nbake until golden brown for about 45 minutes at gas mark 3\ndo keep an eye on it ! petticoat tails seem to require a little less baking time\nhard to describe the colour to bake until\nfrom experience i know what colour i'm looking for - you don't really want it to be undercooked , but when it's starting get a bit dark around the edges it's probably beginning to get a bit overdone already\nbasically cook until it's just starting to darken round the edges then get it out quick and cool it - i usually place the hot tray on a very cold surface until cool\nwhilst still quite warm in the tray , mark across and cut into finger-shaped pieces - but leave them there in the tray , cut and together until fully cold\nfor petticoat tails it's customary to sprinkle liberally with castor sugar\nsorry to be such a pedant about this recipe ! i feel a bit like a mother hen clucking about \"must do this -- \" , \"should do that -- \" :) but it is worth taking some care over as the resulting shortbread will be so good you'll be hassled to make it much more often by everyone you share the pieces with :)\nserving suggestion:\njust on its own with a nice cup of tea or coffee , but also scrumptious on a plate with and / or dunked into a generous helping of creamy cornish dairy ice-cream and strawberries , jam or fresh fruit\npersonal\ni live an ultra low-fat , low-sugar , calorie-controlled lifestyle\nnotwithstanding , i still make and eat pieces of this shortbread occasionally despite the fact that there's nothing remotely low fat , low-sugar or low calorie about it\nat least there's not much salt !\nyou can make substitutions or add essences and flavourings and it'll probably work out fine but it won't be the same shortbread - it won't taste the same , it won't have the same texture , but the efforts you've put into making it will have been the same\ni reckon it's got to be worth trying it without substitutions first time around - you can always give the pieces that you know are much more than you really should be letting yourself scoff to friends and family who will bless you for it ! and you don't need to eat them all at once ! - they keep well in a biscuit tin or cookie jar in a cool , dark place for quite a long time\ni guess you could probably freeze them too\nadditions suggestions:\noccasionally just for a change , right near the end of kneading i have added glace cherries , or occasionally sultanas or raisins , sometimes with and sometimes without cinnamon\ncherries worked ok , but wasnt crazy about the fruit\nyou could even split the kneaded mixture in two and do half plain and half with extra stuff then nudge them together in the baking tray for baking\ni've never tried dessicated / flakes coconut or chunky milk / dark chocolate chips or crystallized ginger pieces perhaps with a bit of ground ginger in with the mix though i've often been tempted to - do let me know how they turn out if you do !\ni do know that dipping the tops from above at an angle into good quality melted real chocolate so that the bottom remains uncoated and only half of the top is coated then leaving to cool is absolute heaven on earth in the eating\nit also occurred to me while choco-dunking one time to add some dessicated coconut into the chocolate first - but i didn't have any - bet it's nice though !\ndo enjoy and best wishes from england - and scotland !\nTags:\ntime-to-make\ncourse\nmain-ingredient\ncuisine\npreparation\noccasion\nfor-large-groups\n5-ingredients-or-less\nlunch\nsnacks\neggs-dairy\noven\neasy\neuropean\nbeginner-cook\nfinger-food\nholiday-event\nkid-friendly\nkosher\nscottish\ndietary\ngifts\nchristmas\ncomfort-food\nbrown-bag\ninexpensive\negg-free\nfree-of-something\ntoddler-friendly\ntaste-mood\nsweet\nto-go\nequipment\nnumber-of-servings\npresentation\nserved-cold\n4-hours-or-less",

      "they're only about 6 to 8 inches in diameter",
      "if you're in a pinch and can't find a pie pumpkin , here's a",
      "just like selecting any squash , look for one that is firm , no bruises or soft spots , and a good orange color",
      "one 6\" pie pumpkin usually makes one 10 inch deep dish pie and a bit extra",

      "wash the exterior of the pumpkin in cool or warm water , no soap",
      "cut the pumpkin in half",
      "a serrated knife and a sawing motion works best - a smooth knife is more likely to slip and hurt you ! a visitor suggests using a hand saw",
      "and scrape the insides",
      "you want to get out that stringy , dangly stuff that coats the inside surface",
      "i find a heavy ice cream scoop works great for this",
      "the seeds can be used either to plant pumpkins next year , or roasted to eat this year ! place them in a bowl of water and rub them between your hands",
      "then pick out the orange buts and drain off the water",
      "spread them out on a clean towel or paper towel to dry and they're ready to save for next year's planting or roast",
      "there are several ways to cook the pumpkin",
      "just choose use your preferred method",
      "most people have microwaves and a stove , so i'll describe both of those methods here",
      "but others make good arguments in favor of using a pressure cooker or baking in the oven",
      "at the end of this document , ive included alternative instructions to replace step 4 , if youd rather use a different method",
      "method 1 - put it in a microwaveable bowl",
      "remove the stem , and put the pumpkin into a microwaveable",
      "you may need to cut the pumpkin further to make it fit",
      "the fewer the number of pieces , the easier it will to scoop out the cooked pumpkin afterwards",
      "put a couple of inches of water in the bowl , cover it , and put in the microwave",
      "method 2 - steam on the stovetop",
      "you can also cook it on the stovetop",
      "it takes about the same length of time in a steamer",
      "i use a double pot steamer , but you could use an ordinary large pot with a steamer basket inside",
      "either way , cook for 15 minutes on high , check to see if it is soft , then repeat in smaller increments of time until it is soft enough to scoop the innards out",
      "normally it takes 20 or 30 minutes in total",

      "again , don't go to great lengths to remove water",
      "the recipe accounts for the fact that fresh pumpkin is more watery than canned !",
      "to get a nice , smooth consistency , i use a pillsbury hand blender",
      "by blending it , you give the pie a smooth , satiny texture",
      "rather than the rough graininess that is typical of cooked squashes",
      "a regular blender works , too",
      "or a food processor or even just a hand mixer with time and patience",
      "with the hand blender , it just takes 2 or 3 minutes !",

      "get the frozen daiquiris out from step 7 and take a break ! :) you may freeze the pie filling",
      "yes , i know there are ready-made pie crusts in the frozen section at the store , but they really are bland and doughy",

      "it is also time to start preheating the oven",
      "turn it on and set it to 425f",

      "5)",
      "like a deep , full pie , so i fill it right up to about one quarter to one half inch from the very top",

      "it will be a crustless pumpkin pie that kids especially love !",
      "bake at 425f for the first 15 minutes , then turn the temperature down to 350f and bake another 45 to 60 minutes , until a clean knife inserted into the center comes out clean",
      "and enjoy ! warm or chilled , with whipped cream , ice cream or nothing at all - it's great !",
      "i use a blunt table knife to test the pie",

beyond , that , i have not found that the water makes a difference - i wouldn't be too concerned about it !\nto eliminate watery pumpkin i strain my pureed pumpkin through a cloth overnight\nif i use frozen pumpkin i do the same again as it thaws out\nit works great and my pies cook beautifully\n\"\nanother visitor reported success using coffee filters in a sieve to drain out excess water\nagain , don't go to great lengths to remove water\nthe recipe accounts for the fact that fresh pumpkin is more watery than canned !\nto get a nice , smooth consistency , i use a pillsbury hand blender\nby blending it , you give the pie a smooth , satiny texture\nrather than the rough graininess that is typical of cooked squashes\na regular blender works , too\nor a food processor or even just a hand mixer with time and patience\nwith the hand blender , it just takes 2 or 3 minutes !\nanother visitor says using a food mill , like a foley food mill , with a fine screen , accomplishes the blending / pureeing very well , too !\nthe pumpkin is now cooked and ready for the pie recipe\nget the frozen daiquiris out from step 7 and take a break ! :) you may freeze the pie filling\nyes , i know there are ready-made pie crusts in the frozen section at the store , but they really are bland and doughy\na flaky crust is easy to make ! again ,\nit is also time to start preheating the oven\nturn it on and set it to 425f\nall the hard work is behind you ! here's where it gets really easy\nif you start with a fresh 8\" pie pumpkin , you will get about 3 cups of cooked , mashed pumpkin\nthe right amount of ingredients for this is as follows:\n1 cup sugar - or 1 cup splenda , or 3 / 4 cup honey\n1\n5 teaspoon ground cinnamon\n1 teaspoon ground cloves\n1 teaspoon ground allspice\none half teaspoon ground ginger\none half teaspoon salt\n4 large eggs\n3 cups pumpkin glop\n1\n5 cans of evaporated milk\nmix well using a hand blender or mixer\nit's light and fluffy - however -- if you want a heavy , more dense pie , use 3 eggs instead of 4 and 1 can of evaporated milk instead of 1\n5)\nlike a deep , full pie , so i fill it right up to about one quarter to one half inch from the very top\ndon't be surprised if the mixture is very runny ! it may start as a soupy liquid , but it will firm up nicely in the oven !\nit will be a crustless pumpkin pie that kids especially love !\nbake at 425f for the first 15 minutes , then turn the temperature down to 350f and bake another 45 to 60 minutes , until a clean knife inserted into the center comes out clean\nand enjoy ! warm or chilled , with whipped cream , ice cream or nothing at all - it's great !\ni use a blunt table knife to test the pie\nthe one at left has already been stuck in the pie , and you see it comes out pretty clean , when the pie is done\nTags:\ntime-to-make\npreparation\noccasion\nholiday-event\nthanksgiving\n4-hours-or-less",

    "description": "after posting this recipe, and making the bread at least 3 times a week, i have simplified the rising process, and eliminated the messy parts. the original recipe comes from baker jim lahey of the sullivan street bakery, and has been discussed on zaar. i have tweaked it a bit, and this is the closest i can come to those french \"boules\". it is real bread bread, not chemical cottonwool. all you need is time. the instructions are terribly long, but once you've read through it, you will see it's only to make the already-easy process still easier. now you only need hunt up a suitably heavy pot with lid ... this is the best bread i've eaten in years. update, 13-8-07: decided to try and use 4 cups flour to get a fatter loaf. it worked, and with the same smallish pot i got a lovely loaf. this 2nd recipe is tacked on to the instruction list. good luck! by the way, if you want wholewheat bread, don't use this recipe. rather use your bread machine or your normal way of bread-making. this very french-style loaf should be made from white bread flour, and you can add in a little fine rye flour. sometimes i add 1 cup of \"brown bread grain flour\" which is very finely stone-milled, and has no large bran flakes. but basically, this is a white bread. go on, indulge! slice a piece for yourself when you can handle it and the crust is still crunchy-hard ... heaven!",
    "minutes": 70,
    "ingredients": [
      "white bread flour",
      "instant yeast",
      "sugar",
      "salt",
      "water"
    ],
    "steps": [
      "since first making this bread according to the original instructions , i've simplified the process",
      "i have now bought a fairly deep plastic bowl with sloping edges , so it has a smallish bottom",
      "the plastic seems almost -- not quite -- non-stick , and this is the method i use now:",
      "in such a lightly greased plastic bowl , put the flour , and add the yeast , sugar and salt",
      "you may want to add less salt , but we found the original amount not enough",
      "mix through",
      "add the water and stir the lot through until well mixed to a nice , smooth , quite sloppy dough",
      "cover bowl with plastic wrap and put a kitchen terry towel or two over the top as well",
      "stand in a draught-free place for 18 hours",
      "for me it works best to mix this up at 3pm",
      "this means the dough is ready at 9am the next morning and i don't even have to get up early like my grandmother did to bake those huge farm loaves in the old days",
      "after 18 hours the dough should be puffy and have little bubble holes on top and have more or less doubled in size , but don't worry too much about that",
      "instead of -- as the original recipe said -- turning out the dough on to a towel , do the following: from the sides of the bowl , scrape the dough away with light movements and fold it over on itself with floury fingers",
      "turn the bowl round and round , flattening the dough by repeating this \"folding over\"",
      "lightly press a little flatter",
      "cover bowl with same plastic used before , and same terry towels",
      "leave to rise again -- 2 hours long",
      "half an hour before the 2 hours are up , put your oven on 450 deg f / 220 deg celsius",
      "at the same time you need a heavy pot with a fitting lid , and this will go into the cold , heating-up oven , empty",
      "the lid is to keep in the steam and cause that wonderful crust to form",
      "nothing beats an iron pot",
      "le creuset will do too , and ceramic has been mentioned",
      "i use a non-stick oval-shaped iron pot with a domed lid",
      "you do not need a \"6 - 8 quart pot\" as stated in the original recipe",
      "it's a small bread",
      "my iron pot is a 2 1 / 2 quart pot , which translates to roughly 2 1 / 2 litres as well",
      "i grease the pot and lid with real butter , and sometimes i slosh in some olive oil",
      "i don't know why , but i feel i should do it",
      "now put the pot in the oven , lid on",
      "after the 2 hours of the 2nd rising , and when the oven and pot has reached its correct heat , take out that piping hot pot very carefully",
      "have the covered dough nearby , and a silicone or other spatula",
      "tilt the plastic bowl over the smoking pot and with spatula or fingers scrape the dough lightly and evenly into the hot pot",
      "it will sizzle as it falls into the pot",
      "don't worry about that",
      "shake the pot slightly to distribute the dough , put on the lid , and carefully shove the whole shebang into the hot oven",
      "bake 30 minutes with lid , then open oven and take off lid",
      "bake 15 - 30 minutes more , until your bread has a golden crust",
      "i find that about 15 - 20 minutes after taking off the lid the bread is ready",
      "baking times will differ because ovens differ",
      "turn out , and swallow that saliva until it's just cooled enough so you can saw off the end part to eat with real butter",
      "on your own",
      "when cold , do not put in plastic bag",
      "use a paper bag at most",
      "i simply turn it on to the cut side on the breadboard , and cover it with a kitchen towel",
      "it lasts until it's been eaten , which doesn't take long",
      "do not refrigerate , which would be silly",
      "a few points: 1",
      "z-mail me for questions 2",
      "your experience might be \"messier\" than mine",
      "it depends on the consistency of the dough and the bowl you use",
      "but greasing the bowl right at the start does help",
      "3",
      "keep to the hours mentioned",
      "it's meant to be a sloooow rising process",
      "4",
      "be careful not to burn yourself ! 5",
      "i have just found , praise the angels , a wonderful , very fine stone-milled 100% organic flour , and have just put a loaf of that , for the first time , in the oven ! i think this robust , frenchified loaf just cries out for stone-milled flour , fine and creamy or almost white",
      "6",
      "you could use 2 1 / 2 cups white bread flour + 1 / 2 cup fine rye flour",
      "do not use wholewheat flour for this bread , except for maybe a handful: it does not have enough gluten for this bread",
      "good luck !",
      "and a warning , added months later: that pot you use must go into the oven empty , and must heat to the heat of the oven",
      "i tried putting the dough in a cold pot yesterday , and the bread wasn't as successful",
      "it didn't rise nearly as much , and didn't have that lovely artisanal cracked round top",
      "so heat the pot as instructed",
      "making a larger loaf: the warning here is that i use my metric cups and spoons for this , which are very accurate ! fortunately i have a pyrex measuring cup with both metric millilitres and imperial fluid ounces , so i could measure the water absolutely equally",
      "4 x 250 ml flour , or 1 litre or 4 cups",
      "3 / 4 teaspoon yeast , and stir into flour",
      "3 / 4 teaspoon sugar , stir into flour",
      "15 ml or 3 teaspoons salt",
      "600 ml or 19 fluid oz water",
      ": my husband actually calculated -- i'm bad with maths ! -- that the water should be 666 ml -- so add a dash more than 600 ml if you feel it's necessary",
      "just remember to bake this 2nd , larger recipe for the full hour",
      "also , he said the bread needed more salt",
      "we don't eat a lot of salt and i'm not worried about the issue , so i now use 4 teaspoons , i",
      "e",
      "1 tablespoon + 1 teaspoon)",
      "best results are still with white bread flour , stone-milled , or all-purpose , and a little rye flour can be used too",
      "carry on as usual , grease the pot really well or pour some melted butter or olive oil into the hot pot and tilt it to grease bottom",
      "by the way , a silicone spatula works a treat when you tilt the dough into the super-hot pot !",
      "yet another",
      "i have found that the 4-cup-bread needs a full hour"

      "whole wheat flour",
      "salt",
      "oil",
      "water"
    ],
    "steps": [
      "to make the dough we're going to add our flour to a bowl and sprinkle the salt",
      "this is optional , in case you know you don't use salt that's fine too",
      "incorporate the salt well , and then we'll pour oil inside it",
      "now you want to mix the flour again to make sure all the oil gets incorporated in to the flour and you don't want lumps of oil in there",
      "just for a few seconds",
      "when the oil and salt are nicely incorporated , add water slowly",
      "this water has been warmed in the microwave for about 30 seconds , pour little at a time and just mix",
      "we have used whole wheat flour from the indian store as its a little different from the whole wheat flour that you find in the grocery stores",
      "the one in the american grocery stores is usually a lot darker in color , so chapattis turn a little browner than you probably like them , this one is available in any indian store its called chapatti atta and is readily available",
      "just mix all that dough in and form a nice ball",
      "it doesn't take a lot of time at all , but people are scared to do this , because you're using your hands and that freaks people out , but it really is not that bad",
      "it literally takes under a minute to make this dough",
      "when the dough is in a nice ball , we're going to take just a couple of drops of oil , just to lightly coat it and in that way it doesn't form a dry skin on top of the dough",
      "then keep it covered for about 15 to 20 minutes",
      "so if you are not comfortable using your hands while making the dough , here's another alternative way of doing it",
      "here's the whole wheat flour , i'm going to use the food processor , and if you notice i'm using a chopping blade instead of a dough blade , because it just mixes better and it gets all the edges and there's nothing left at the sides",
      "i'm going to mix in the salt at this point and i'm going to give it a mix",
      "then i'm going to add in the oil",
      "i've also heated up the water for 30 seconds and am going to pour it in very slowly once i have the food processor on",
      "this is just as easy",
      "it's best just to give it one knead by hand just to incorporate everything and make sure there's no air bubbles and all in it",
      "this food processor option is really good if you're making dough in bulk because i understand that dough freezes really well",
      "then put a couple of drops of oil and just smother a little bit , rub it a little bit so that it doesn't dry out and cover it up",
      "then set it aside for 15 minutes as before",
      "after it has been resting for about 15 to 20 minutes we're going to knead the dough one more time quickly",
      "this is 1 and 1 / 2 cups of dry flour , so it makes approximately 9 chapattis",
      "but there's no signs involved , so if you like really big chapattis it can be less and if you want small ones you know it'll make more",
      "but something that fits in to your palm or close fist , a kind of a golf size ball is perfect",
      "so just divide it out",
      "before we start rolling out our chapattis we'll go ahead and turn on our stove and get our pan heated",
      "the pan we are using is called a tawa",
      "you can also use a non stick frying pan",
      "put the stove on medium heat , or a little bit higher than medium",
      "and you want to make sure your pan is really hot before you put your first chapatti on",
      "so while our pan is heating , we're going to take our dough and form a nice round ball",
      "if you start off with a round ball , the shape changes , but your final chapatti will probably be round also",
      "we're then going to dip it in some dry flour , shake off the excess and role it out",
      "now this rolling pin is my favorite",
      "it's a thinner version , but a lot of people are used to the thicker version of the rolling pins",
      "whatever you have is absolutely fine and if you notice that your chapatti is sticking to the ground or to whatever surface you are rolling out on , take it and dip it again in the dry flour",
      "this is a trick that my mom taught me when i was learning how to do this when i was little , you rub your hand across it , and instantly you'll feel where its thicker and where it's thinner and then you can just roll the parts that are thicker , that way you don't have a chapatti that is really thin on one side and really thick on the other side that also helps in blowing up when you're cooking it",
      "the tawa looks hot so we're going to put our rolled chapatti in and move it around to make sure it doesn't stick",
      "then we leave it alone until we start seeing bubbles appearing , and then we're going to flip it around , and let go for a few seconds",
      "now we're going to take some oil and you can just dip your spoon in to your oil and then whatever is left , the remainder few drops , just put it on and smear it on like that and flip it around and press",
      "you want to press where it bubbles to force the air to the other side which is not risen yet",
      "smear the oil again and press",
      "you want to cook the chapatti until you see that all the doughiness is gone and it looks fully cooked",
      "it's ok to have little brown spots on it",
      "it looks delicious and there's nothing like home made chapattis",
      "you can buy these from the store but when you taste these like fresh off the stove it's awesome",
      "and one of the other reasons why it doesn't taste as nice sometimes is a lot of people don't use oil in their chapattis , but i put oil inside the dough and what happens with that is that when you eat the chapatti a little bit later on , it still tastes nice and soft , as supposed to the dough which has been prepared without oil , which tends to turn a little bit chewier",
      "once the chapatti is cooked i like to keep it in a nice insulated cannister like this",
      "it helps it to stay nice and warm",
      "so you can finish all your chapattis and sit with you family and enjoy your dinner and they'll still be piping hot",
      "enjoy !"

      "scrape the sponge into a 2-quart clear plastic container and cover with plastic wrap",
      "at this point you have two options: if you plan to make your dough later that same day , let the sponge rest at room temperature until it has risen to the point where it just begins to collapse",
      "this may take from 6 to 8 hours , depending on the temperature of the sponge , the temperature of the room , and the strength of the yeast",
      "the sponge will triple in volume and small dents and folds will begin to appear in the top as it reaches its peak and then begins to deflate",
      "the sponge is now in perfect condition to be used in a dough",
      "it's best if you have already weighed or measured out all of your other recipe ingredients before the sponge reaches this point so you can use it before it collapses too much",
      "if you're not planning to make your dough until the next day or the day after , put the covered sponge in the refrigerator and let it rise there for at least 14 hours before taking it out to use in a recipe",
      "be sure to compensate for the cold temperature of the starter by using warm water in the dough instead of the cool water specified in the recipe",

    "raw_text": "crusty italian loaf\nIngredients:\nwater\nactive dry yeast\nunbleached all-purpose flour\nactive starter\nkosher salt\ncornmeal\nSteps:\nbiga: mix all the ingredients together in a medium bowl and stir vigorously with a wooden spoon for 2 to 3 minutes , until a smooth , somewhat elastic batter has formed\nthe batter will be very stiff\nit gets softer and more elastic after it has proofed\nyou may find it easier to mix the sponge using electric mixer , with a paddle or a dough hook , on medium speed for 1 to 2 minutes\nscrape the sponge into a 2-quart clear plastic container and cover with plastic wrap\nat this point you have two options: if you plan to make your dough later that same day , let the sponge rest at room temperature until it has risen to the point where it just begins to collapse\nthis may take from 6 to 8 hours , depending on the temperature of the sponge , the temperature of the room , and the strength of the yeast\nthe sponge will triple in volume and small dents and folds will begin to appear in the top as it reaches its peak and then begins to deflate\nthe sponge is now in perfect condition to be used in a dough\nit's best if you have already weighed or measured out all of your other recipe ingredients before the sponge reaches this point so you can use it before it collapses too much\nif you're not planning to make your dough until the next day or the day after , put the covered sponge in the refrigerator and let it rise there for at least 14 hours before taking it out to use in a recipe\nbe sure to compensate for the cold temperature of the starter by using warm water in the dough instead of the cool water specified in the recipe\nor let the starter sit out , covered , until it reaches room temperature -but don't let it collapse to much before you use it\nbread: combine the warm water and yeast in a large bowl and stir with a fork to dissolve the yeast\nlet stand for 3 minutes\nadd the cool water and biga to the yeast mixture and mix with your fingers for about 2 minutes , breaking up the biga\nthe mixture should look milky and slightly foamy\nadd the flour and salt and mix with your fingers to incorporate the flour , scraping the sides of the bowl and folding the ingredients together until the dough gathers into a mass\nit will be wet and sticky , with long strands of dough hanging from your fingers\nif the dough is not sticky , add 1 tablespoon of water\nmove the dough to a lightly floured surface and knead for about 5 minutes , until it becomes supple and fairly smooth\nthis is a sticky , wet dough\ndon't be tempted to add more flour to the work surface\njust dust lightly and use a dough scraper as necessary to loosen the dough from the table during kneading\nallow the dough to rest for 15 minutes , covered with oiled plastic wrap knead the dough 3 to 5 minutes , until it is stretchy and smooth , yet still slightly sticky\nshape the dough into a loose ball , place it in a lightly oiled bowl , and turn the dough in the bowl to coat with oil\ncover the bowl tightly with plastic wrap and let the dough rise at room temperature for about 1 hour , or until the dough looks slightly puffy but has not doubled\nplace the dough in the refrigerator for at least 8 hours , or preferably , overnight to let it relax , develop flavor , and become more manageable\ntake the dough from the refrigerator and let it sit at room temperature for 1 to 2 hours , until it begins to warm up and starts to rise\nflour a work surface well and gently dump the dough onto it\ndivide the dough into three equal pieces , about 13 ounces each\ngently flatten one piece , pressing out some of the air bubbles , and stretch it into a rectangle\nfold the top third down and the bottom third up as if you were folding a business letter\nnow form the loaf into a short baguette by rolling the dough over from left to right and sealing the seam with the heel of your palm\nfold the dough over about 1 / 3 of the way each time , seal the length of the loaf , then repeat\nyou want to gently draw the skin tight over the surface of the loaf while leaving some air bubbles in the dough\nseal the seam , being careful not to tear the skin of the dough or deflate its airy structure\ndo not elongate\nthese loaves are about 10 inches long\ncover an area on the work surface with a thick layer of flour and place the loaf , seam side down , on the flour\nrepeat with remaining pieces of dough\nthe loaves will be loose and slightly irregular in shape\nleave plenty of space between the loaves they will spread as they rise\ncover the loaves with well oiled plastic and let them rise for 1 to 2 hours , until bubbly and loose\nthirty minutes before baking , preheat the oven to 475 degrees f\nplace a baking stone in the oven to preheat and position an oven rack just below the stone\nsprinkle a peel very generously with cornmeal\nline an upside-down baking sheet with parchment paper and sprinkle very generously with cornmeal\nlift one loaf , flip it over so the floured side is on top , and gently tug on the ends to stretch the loaf to the full length of the peel , or about 14 inches on a pan\nrepeat with the remaining loaves , placing 2 on the peel and 1 on the pan\ndimple each loaf with your finger in about 6 places , but don't deflate them too much\nbe sure the loaves are loosened from the peel , then carefully slide them onto the baking stone\nplace the pan of bread on the rack below the stone\nusing a plant sprayer , quickly mist the loaves with water 8 to 10 times , then quickly shut oven door\nmist the loaves again after 1 minute\nthen mist again 1 minute later\nbake for about 10 minutes , then reduce the temperature to 450 degrees and bake 15 minutes longer or until the loaves sound slightly hollow when tapped on the bottom and the crust is a medium to dark brown\ntransfer the bread to a rack to cool for at least 30 minutes before

      "let it heat over low heat for 10 minutes , stirring well about halfway through",

      "best:if you make the braggs apple cider vinegar health drink you can try adding this for an extra kick",
      "while this is subject to opinion , i think it tastes good stirred in to tea or a glass of lemon water in the morning",
      "apple cider vinegar can help neutralize and correct excess acidity in our bodies and helps a number of issues from an upset stomach to easing sore throats to showing promise in treating diabetes",

      "simply store in a cool place away from direct sunlight",
      "straining is more for looks / taste , and is easiest when the honey has been warmed slightly after sitting for a few hours so it is runnier",

      "when its infused enough , simply re-heat before straining by placing the jar in warm water if youd like",

one freshly squeezed lemon\nwhen its still hot and liquid , sip slowly\ncinnamon honey:\npour 1 cup of honey into the saucepan , and drop in the cinnamon sticks\npush them down with a spoon to submerge them\nfor 10 minutes on low heat let the mixture heat up , and then let it sit for around 2 hours or up to 1-2 weeks\nstrain if youd like and store in glass jar\ngood if used: in tea , just like the lemon-honey , or eaten straight off the spoon\nits also delicious spread on a plain piece of toast\ncinnamon is chock full of anti-oxidants , possesses antifungal properties , and helps break up congestions / clear the sinuses\neven just a half a teaspoon a day has been shown to lower cholesterol levels\nginger honey:\npour 1 cup of honey into a saucepan and add 1 tablespoon of finely chopped gingerroot\nyou can add a small pinch of ground ginger if youd like as well , but it does have a strong flavor\non low heat let the mixture sit for 10 minutes\nwhen its done let it infuse for 2 hours or up to 2 weeks in a glass jar with a tightly fitting lid\nstrain when its finished if youd like\nbest used: in your tea when youre feeling ill-especially with an upset tummy , since both ginger and honey are known to soothe your stomach and chase off bugs\nthe added ginger helps circulation , flushing toxins through your systems and helping get rid of aches and chills\nif youre in a pinch and have wound up with a minor abrasion , applying this cooled and then covering with gauze can help it heal , and the ginger fights inflammation\nnot to be confused with clover honey , clove honey is made by infusing whole cloves with honey , whereas clover honey is made from the nectar of clover flowers\ncloves are great at numbing pain and the honey makes a happy , healthy , medium to ingest it with\npour 1 cup of honey into a saucepan , and then add 5-10 whole cloves\non low , heat for 10 minutes before letting it infuse for 2 hours or up to 2 weeks , putting it in a jar with a tightly fitting lid\nstrain when its finished if youd like\nbest used: in tea when you have a sore throat or a toothache , or dabbed directly on the gum by a sore tooth\nthe eugenol in the clove is a powerful numbing agent that was used by dentists before modern painkillers were created , and is so effective it is still used in modern dentistry in an extracted form\nif you have a little cut or sore in your mouth , the honey may help it heal faster and keep bad bacteria out while the cloves take care of the discomfort\napple cider vinegar honey:\nadd 1 cup of honey to a saucepan , and then pour in 2-3 tablespoons of apple cider vinegar\nlet it heat over low heat for 10 minutes , stirring well about halfway through\nplace in a jar and let it sit for as long as you like-its taste and benefits are all there pretty quickly , and it doesnt need to sit as long as something like cinnamon sticks or cloves would\nbest:if you make the braggs apple cider vinegar health drink you can try adding this for an extra kick\nwhile this is subject to opinion , i think it tastes good stirred in to tea or a glass of lemon water in the morning\napple cider vinegar can help neutralize and correct excess acidity in our bodies and helps a number of issues from an upset stomach to easing sore throats to showing promise in treating diabetes\nstorage:\nthe shelf-life , if stored in a glass jar with a tightly fitting lid , is 6 months\nsome people say it can last years , but i have never experimented with that\neven with plant matter , it can go a long time without needing to be refrigerated\nsimply store in a cool place away from direct sunlight\nstraining is more for looks / taste , and is easiest when the honey has been warmed slightly after sitting for a few hours so it is runnier\nif you want to let it infuse for longer than several hours , pour it into your jar so its not sitting out in the open for a super long time\nwhen its infused enough , simply re-heat before straining by placing the jar in warm water if youd like\n-if crystals form , set the honey in a pot of gently simmered water\nthe crystals will melt and your honey will be smooth again\n-a nice touch for flavor is to add 3 tablespoons of diced or roughly chopped fruit\napple-strawberry is one of my favorite flavors for eating on toast with butter\ni dont strain it at the end either\n-flavored honey makes an awesome gift in a nice decorative jar , and you can actually get honeystix at many craft / party stores\n-freely adjust to taste , and experiment\nits not an exact science , and its all about what you like and whats good for you\nTags:\nweeknight\n15-minutes-or-less\ntime-to-make\ncourse\ncuisine\npreparation\noccasion\nnorth-american\ncondiments-etc\nafrican\neasy\neuropean\nvegan\nvegetarian\ndietary\ngifts",

    "steps": [
      "mixer method-----------",
      "in the large bowl of a heavy-duty electric mixer that has a dough-kneading hook , put about 5 cups of the bread flour , yeast , sugar , salt , and seeds",
      "mix the dry ingredients by holding the hook in your hand and using it to stir",
      "add 3 eggs and the oil and honey to the flour mixture , and stir in with the hook",
      "it is not necessary to mix well",
      "finally , add the hot water and stir in",
      "set the bowl into the mixer , and attach the dough hook",
      "turn the mixer to kneading speed",
      "if the dough is very wet and soft , add about cup flour or enough so that the dough begins to gather around the hook",
      "as the dough kneads , lightly sprinkle just enough flour around the inside surface of the bowl so that the dough stays on the hook and does not come down off the hook into the bottom of the bowl",
      "you will probably need to use more flour in the beginning , and less as the dough kneads",
      "let the dough knead for about 5 to 10 minutes , or until it is very smooth",
      "when it is almost done kneading , it should need very little or no more flour and should almost clean the inner surface of the bowl",
      "this may happen if the bowl is too small for the recipe",
      "consider reducing the recipe by one-third in the future",
      "remove the dough hook from the dough , but leave the dough in the mixer bowl",
      "cover the bowl with a plastic lid or a piece of plastic wrap so the dough does not dry out , and let it rest for 20 minutes",
      "it will probably not rise very much",
      "hand method-----------",
      "in a large bowl , combine 4 cups of the bread flour , yeast , sugar , and salt , and mix to combine using a sturdy mixing spoon",
      "add 3 eggs and the oil and honey to the flour mixture , and stir in lightly",
      "finally , add the hot water , and stir it in very well",
      "stir in about 1 1 / 2 cups more flour , and mix to make a soft , sticky dough",
      "let the dough rest , covered , for about 5 minutes to allow the flour to absorb some moisture",
      "turn out the dough onto a well-floured surface , and knead , adding small sprinkles of flour as needed to keep the dough from sticking to your hands or the surface",
      "try to keep your hands free of sticky dough , as this will make even more dough stick",
      "to clean your hands , sprinkle them lightly with flour and rub them together",
      "knead for about 10 to 15 minutes , or until the dough is very smooth and silky feeling , and is no longer sticky",
      "to keep the dough from drying out , put it into an ungreased covered bowl , or turn a bowl over the dough on the kneading surface , or cover the dough with plastic",
      "let it rest for 20 minutes",
      "it will probably not rise very much",
      "both methods-----------",
      "while the dough is resting , prepare the baking sheets",
      "use large , heavy , flat , shiny aluminum baking sheets and coat them with nonstick cooking spray or top them with special parchment paper used for baking",
      "to easily remove the dough from a bowl , sprinkle a little extra flour over the dough , and use a spatula to push the flour all the way down the sides of the bowl while completely loosening the dough at the same time",
      "turn out the dough onto a lightly floured board , and press it gently into a rough mound of even thickness",
      "cut the dough in half",
      "shape each half into a spiral loaf adding raisins , if desired , as directed below",
      "be careful not to stretch or tear the dough as you shape it , or the surface of the loaf may develop holes when it rises and bakes",
      "for a spiral-----------",
      "with very lightly floured hands , gently squeeze the dough into a snake of even thickness that is about 36 inches long",
      "place the snake horizontally on a lightly floured countertop or other surface",
      "use your finger",
      "if using raisins , press about cup of them into the top of the dough , arranging them so that none are touching and the whole surface is covered",
      "beginning with the long edge closest to you , tightly roll up the dough like a very long jelly roll , forming a neat log",
      "pinch the remaining long edge of the dough tightly against the log so that it cannot unroll , and pinch both ends of the log closed",
      "gently roll the log on a floured surface to smooth down the pinched long edge and to coat the log completely with flour",
      "brush off any excess flour",
      "with your hand , raise one end of the log so it points upward",
      "fold it over about 2 inches so the rough end of the log will not show at the top of the loaf , but still keep this end slightly raised so it will be the highest part of the loaf",
      "use your other hand to neatly wind the rest of the log around the bent end in a spiral fashion , keeping the seam side down",
      "tuck the final end neatly under the bottom of the round loaf , and pinch it against the loaf so that the spiral cannot unravel",
      "carefully transfer the loaf to the center of a prepared baking sheet",
      "repeat with the second half of the dough to form another round loaf",
      "these are large challot , and each must be placed on its own baking sheet",
      "as soon as the loaves are shaped , brush them heavily with egg glaze",
      "for the glaze , beat the remaining egg with a teaspoon of water until the egg is barely frothy",

    ],
    "steps": [
      "this recipe takes two days to make , not continuous work mind you , but short periods of intense activity , separated by many hours of slothful relaxation",
      "there are two main phases , the first is to make the meaty turkey broth base , the second , to make the complete stew",
      "phase - i",
      "secure a large crock pot or conventional pot of at least six quarts capacity",
      "if you do not have one , procure one from a neighbor",
      "a handgun may be helpful if they are not very cooperative",
      "take the turkey carcass and violently rip it limb-from-limb until it fits into your pot",
      "if you are timid , find another more \"pc\" recipe , you pretender !",
      "fill the pot with ordinary water to cover the turkey",
      "i typically use five to six quarts",
      "no fancy froo-froo water from places like france is needed",
      "if you think you need it anyway , then get the hell out of dodge and find another recipe !",
      "slice the carrot into less than 1 / 8\" slices and put into the pot",
      "strain the garlic cloves finely and put in pot",
      "add 1 tbsp of the dried celery leaves",
      "put the pot on the stovetop on low heat for 3 to 4 hours , or until the meat simply falls off the bone",
      "do not boil , just use slow heat with a few bubbles rising",
      "boiling will kill the flavor",
      "a large crockpot can also be used",
      "after truning off the heat , let the pot cool down for an hour , and then place it into the fridge overnight",
      "i do this so the fat in the broth will rise to the top and harden , so it can be easily removed in the morning",
      "leaving the fat in this stew will inflate your waistline -- as if the beer you drink isn't doing enough !",
      "phase - ii",
      "the next morning , get the pot from the fridge and skim off the fat from the top with a large spoon",
      "then you will have to get your hands dirty",
      "if you have recently changed the oil in your bike , you better scrub up but good",
      "clean hands are a must",
      "separate the meat from the bones by hand",
      "i set up two large bowls , one for bones and gristle , the other for cleaned turkey meat",
      "remove the meat and bones from the pot and separate into the two bowls until there is only broth left in the pot",
      "put the remnants of the skin , the carrot slices , and anything that looks funny to you in the bone bowl",
      "toss what is in the bone bowl into the trash or out the window if you have no trash can",
      "next go through the meat bowl and cut up any large chunks of meat with a knife",
      "i like to chop it in the direction of the muscle fibers so you leave long shreds of meat",
      "that makes things interesting in the bowl when eating , unlike the factory-made stuff you get in cans",
      "for six quarts of soup use about 1-1 / 2 quarts of shredded turkey",
      "if you have more meat than that , set it aside and use it for burrito filling",
      "if you use more meat it becomes too thick",
      "place the pot of broth on the stove and start to heat it slowly",
      "put the burner on medium heat to start , no hurry now",
      "toss in the turkey from the meat bowl , open the cans of sweet corn , drain them of water , and put the corn into the pot",
      "then open the can of tomatoes and put it all into the pot without draining",
      "slice the onions and peppers into strips , less than 1 / 4 inch wide and at least 1-1 / 2 inches long",
      "do not finely chop , unless you want to make a bland uninteresting chowder",
      "brown the onions and peppers in a large pan in oil",
      "hey ! don't use a lot of oil , this is a low fat recipe",
      "turn the sliced veggies so they don't burn , yet get a bit brown on the edges",
      "then dump them into the pot",
      "next add the rest of the dried celery leaves , the ancho chili powder , the coriander , and cayenne",
      "stir well",
      "then wait for the pot to start bubbling",
      "not boiling -- just slowly bubbling",
      "while you are waiting for this , squeeze the juice from the limes into a bowl",
      "then thoroughly wash about 2 / 3 of the bunch of cilantro and strip the leaves from the stems with a knife",
      "the remaining 1 / 3 bunch will be used later as garnish when serving",
      "when the pot starts to bubble , turn the heat down to low and add 3 / 4 of the lime juice and the cilantro leaves",
      "do not boil",
      "if your pot is not full to six quarts capacity , now is the time to add more water",
      "this recipe is for six quarts of stew",
      "now add salt to taste",
      "i usually end up adding about 1+ level tbsp , but you might like it different",
      "cover the pot and let it very slowly bubble for 1 to 1-1 / 2 hours",
      "if it bubbles vigorously , turn the heat down even more",
      "stir it up about every ten minutes or so so it all gets well mixed together",
      "then about 10 minutes before the end add the remaining lime juice",
      "this is the time to taste it to see if you need more salt , lime or other ingredients to taste",
      "after you take the pot off the heat , let it sit about 30 minutes to let the flavors blend and develop more",
      "with this stew , the longer you wait , the better it gets",
      "serve it up in large bowls",
      "i like to add a few tbsp of salsa verde and a large dollop of sour cream in the middle of each bowl",
      "don't stir it in , just plunk it into the bowl",
      "this adds a bit of temperature and flavor contrast to the stew",
      "then garnish with the rest of the cilantro",
      "and hey , there is not need to eat it right away ! this stew is even better after you cool it in the fridge for a day and reheat",
      "if you don't have hungry guests that need to eat right away , set it aside , and go for a ride instead",
      "it will be even better the next day"

don't use a lot of oil , this is a low fat recipe\nturn the sliced veggies so they don't burn , yet get a bit brown on the edges\nthen dump them into the pot\nnext add the rest of the dried celery leaves , the ancho chili powder , the coriander , and cayenne\nstir well\nthen wait for the pot to start bubbling\nnot boiling -- just slowly bubbling\nwhile you are waiting for this , squeeze the juice from the limes into a bowl\nthen thoroughly wash about 2 / 3 of the bunch of cilantro and strip the leaves from the stems with a knife\nthe remaining 1 / 3 bunch will be used later as garnish when serving\nwhen the pot starts to bubble , turn the heat down to low and add 3 / 4 of the lime juice and the cilantro leaves\ndo not boil\nif your pot is not full to six quarts capacity , now is the time to add more water\nthis recipe is for six quarts of stew\nnow add salt to taste\ni usually end up adding about 1+ level tbsp , but you might like it different\ncover the pot and let it very slowly bubble for 1 to 1-1 / 2 hours\nif it bubbles vigorously , turn the heat down even more\nstir it up about every ten minutes or so so it all gets well mixed together\nthen about 10 minutes before the end add the remaining lime juice\nthis is the time to taste it to see if you need more salt , lime or other ingredients to taste\nafter you take the pot off the heat , let it sit about 30 minutes to let the flavors blend and develop more\nwith this stew , the longer you wait , the better it gets\nserve it up in large bowls\ni like to add a few tbsp of salsa verde and a large dollop of sour cream in the middle of each bowl\ndon't stir it in , just plunk it into the bowl\nthis adds a bit of temperature and flavor contrast to the stew\nthen garnish with the rest of the cilantro\nand hey , there is not need to eat it right away ! this stew is even better after you cool it in the fridge for a day and reheat\nif you don't have hungry guests that need to eat right away , set it aside , and go for a ride instead\nit will be even better the next day\nTags:\ntime-to-make\ncourse\nmain-ingredient\ncuisine\npreparation\nnorth-american\nmain-dish\npoultry\namerican\nsouthwestern-united-states\ntex-mex\n1-day-or-more\neasy\nturkey\ncrock-pot-slow-cooker\nstove-top\none-dish-meal\ninexpensive\nmeat\nwhole-turkey\nequipment\npresentation\nserved-hot",

    "description": "this is a step by step recipe to create a stable sweet meringue for virtually any type of pie, enough to cover a 9 inch pie well. if you use the lower sugar amount with the cornstarch mixture this meringue is almost guaranteed not to weep. the original recipe came from my paternal grandmother, eva winston conley of west texas. she also taught me how to properly crack a raw egg and separate it.",
    "minutes": 60,
    "ingredients": [
      "egg whites",
      "cream of tartar",
      "salt",
      "granulated sugar",
      "vanilla extract"
    ],
    "steps": [
      "if you are using the meringue for a baked pie begin making the meringue at least 20 minutes before the pie is done baking so that the meringue can be applied to a piping hot filling",
      "once the meringue is made it should be applied to the pie within 5 minutes or it will begin to lose volume",
      "if you are using the meringue for a refrigerated pie instead of using cream of tartar make a cornstarch mixture by combining 1 tablespoon of cornstarch and mixing thoroughly with 1 / 3 cup of cold water , heat the mixture on the stove in a small saucepan while stirring constantly over low heat until it thickens , then set aside to cool",
      "for a meringue with more volume start with refrigerated eggs that are at least several days old",
      "older egg whites create more volume than newer egg whites",
      "cold eggs separate more easily than temperate eggs because cold egg whites hold together better",
      "use a clean dry large glass or stainless steel mixing bowl to beat the egg whites in , a small clean dry dish to place the egg in and clean dry beaters to beat the egg whites with",
      "egg whites will not whip as well if there is any grease or moisture on the bowl , dish or beaters",
      "separate the egg yolks from the egg whites , cracking the egg shell gently in the center of the side by knocking it against the counter",
      "placing your thumbnails on either side of the crack in the egg shell , gently pull the egg shell halves apart over the dish , transferring the egg yolk from one shell half to the other , allowing the egg white to fall into the dish",
      "repeat this until all the egg white has fallen into the bowl then set aside the egg yolk",
      "if the egg yolk breaks during this step make certain to remove any traces of yolk from the egg whites in the dish using an empty egg shell half or a clean dry spoon",
      "the smallest amount of egg yolk in the egg white mixture can cause the egg whites to fail to whip properly",
      "when all the egg white has been placed in the dish and you are certain that the egg white has no yolk or shell in it - transfer the egg whites to the mixing bowl and repeat for all the remaining eggs",
      "set the egg whites aside",
      "if using refrigerated eggs allow 15 to 20 minutes for the egg whites to warm to room temperature",
      "using either the beaters or a clean dry whisk beat the egg whites until foamy then add the salt and beat well",
      "if you are using the meringue on a pie that will not be refrigerated add the 1 / 2 teaspoon cream of tartar or 1 tablespoon piping gel to the egg white mixture and beat until incorporated",
      "set the mixer to medium high and beat the egg whites until they form soft peaks",
      "reduce the mixer speed to medium and begin to gradually beat the sugar into the egg white mixture one tablespoon at a time",
      "when you have finished adding the sugar it is very important to make certain that the sugar is completely dissolved into the mixture",
      "to test for this simply rub a tiny bit of meringue between your fingers - if you feel any grit in the meringue then the sugar has not been completely incorporated - beat for a minute longer and test again",
      "using extra fine sugar makes this process faster and easier than using table sugar",
      "for a softer meringue use between 1 / 2 to 3 / 4 cup of sugar , for a harder meringue use between 3 / 4 to 1 cup of sugar",
      "a \"french meringue\" would require 1 cup of sugar",
      "if you are using the meringue with a refrigerated pie begin incorporating the cooled cornstarch mixture into the meringue one tablespoon at a time until you have finished adding the cornstarch mixture",
      "now add the vanilla extract and beat until it is well blended into the meringue",
      "the beating process is complete when you can hold a spoonful of meringue upside down and none of the mixture falls off",
      "continue beating the meringue until the peaks are as stiff as you desire",
      "once the meringue forms stiff peaks stop beating - do not over beat the mixture",
      "begin placing the meringue on top of the filling",
      "putting the meringue on a hot filling will seal the meringue underneath and will help to protect the meringue",
      "make certain that the meringue touches the edges of the pie crust as this will help to prevent shrinking later",
      "finish spreading the meringue over the pie",
      "bake the meringue in an oven that is preheated to 325 degrees",
      "bake for 20 to 30 minutes - be careful to watch the meringue closely as it will begin to brown quickly once it nears the end of the baking cycle",
      "overcooking can cause the meringue to become tough , sweat or burn",
      "if you want a meringue that is harder or more done lower the temperature to between 250 to 300 degrees and bake for a longer period of time",
      "meringues should be baked until light brown in color and dry to the touch",
      "serving & storage: cut a meringue pie using a cold wet knife dipping between cuts in cold water",
      "there are conflicting answers on whether or not baked meringues need to be refrigerated",
      "they are perfectly safe at room temperatures for up to 2 hours",
      "meringue pies should be stored in air-tight containers and are best eaten within a day or two",
      "if the pie is refrigerated it will eventually weep",
      "cooked meringue can be stored refrigerated for several days or frozen for up to 3 months",
      "meringue with higher sugar content is more likely to weep since it is the sugar in the meringue that attracts moisture",
      "using the cornstarch mixture in making the meringue helps to reduce weeping in refrigerated or frozen meringue pies",

      "stir well to make sure all the salt is dissolved",
      "prepare the artichokes: do not peel the artichokes - the peel is edible and you will lose a lot of vitamins , plus these things are really knobby and if you try to peel 6 pounds of them i assure you you will lose your enthusiasm for making this relish",

      "i prefer to cut the artichokes into quarter inch dice by hand",
      "other folks use a food processor",
      "the reason i don't use a food processor is because jerusalem artichokes have a unique consistency , and they don't chop well in the food processor",
      "some of them get pulverized , while large chunks remain unchopped",
      "so , if you like , use a food processor , but just make sure you don't end up with mush",
      "you want a lot of very small chunks",
      "it should look about the consistency of relish",
      "as you cut the artichokes , place them in the brine",
      "make a second batch of brine with the remaining cup of salt and one gallon water , stirring well to make sure all the salt dissolves",
      "in a food processor , chop the cabbage , onions , and bell peppers until they are cut fine",
      "make sure to keep an eye on what you are doing so you don't get mush",

the peel is edible and you will lose a lot of vitamins , plus these things are really knobby and if you try to peel 6 pounds of them i assure you you will lose your enthusiasm for making this relish\nchopping: you have two choices here\ni prefer to cut the artichokes into quarter inch dice by hand\nother folks use a food processor\nthe reason i don't use a food processor is because jerusalem artichokes have a unique consistency , and they don't chop well in the food processor\nsome of them get pulverized , while large chunks remain unchopped\nso , if you like , use a food processor , but just make sure you don't end up with mush\nyou want a lot of very small chunks\nit should look about the consistency of relish\nas you cut the artichokes , place them in the brine\nmake a second batch of brine with the remaining cup of salt and one gallon water , stirring well to make sure all the salt dissolves\nin a food processor , chop the cabbage , onions , and bell peppers until they are cut fine\nmake sure to keep an eye on what you are doing so you don't get mush\nyou want the vegetables to be the consistency of a relish\nonce they are chopped , place the vegetables in the second batch of brine you made , and stir well\ncover both bowls of brined vegetables , and leave on the counter overnight or for 8 hours\ndon't let them sit in the brine for longer than 10 hours or the vegetables may become too salty\nline a counter with lots of paper towels - i usually use 5 layers\nyou are going to be placing the drained vegetables on these paper towels , so make sure you cover a fairly large space\nat least 2 1 / 2 feet by 1 1 / 2 feet\ndrain the jerusalem artichokes and rinse with cold water\ndrain well and place on half of the paper towels\ndrain the cabbage / onion / pepper mixture and rinse with cold water\ndrain well , and then with your hands , which you have just washed in hot water with soap , squeeze the remaining moisture out of the vegetables\nyou will see that a lot of water still comes out\nplace the drained and squeezed vegetables on the other half of the paper towels\nin a large bowl , whisk together the french's mustard and the flour\nset aside\nin a very large stockpot , combine the apple cider vinegar , white wine vinegar , sugar , yellow mustard seed , turmeric , celery seed , cayenne pepper , ground allspice , ground cloves , and black pepper\nbring to a boil , stirring well , and then reduce to a simmer\ndip out about 2 cups of the vinegar mixture and add it to the mustard / flour mixture in the bowl , whisking well to combine -

    "description": "tv chefs are always telling you how wonderful their recipes are, so when karen martini of australia's \"better homes and gardens\" tv show said, \"this will be the best roast chicken you've ever made!\" i was sceptical. \"well, it looks pretty good, but i don't know about roast chicken without a nice rich gravy,\" i thought. nevertheless, i decided to give it a try. now i can honestly say, \"this was the best roast chicken i have ever made or eaten\" - and boy i've eaten some roast chicken in my time! now, i must confess to having amended ms martini's excellent recipe a bit. her idea of 'rustic' is to just chop up all the garlic without peeling any of it, throw in the onion with the peel still on, and add the herbs still on their woody stalks. i wasn't keen on the idea of spitting out bits of papery garlic peel and burned bits of stalk as i ate, so i peeled most of the garlic and stripped some of the herbs from their stalks before adding them to the chicken. if you want to be authentically rustic, by all means, just whack everything in with no preparation - it will certainly save a lot of time. the other change i made to the recipe was that i boosted up the sauce a bit. i like lots of sauce, and although the chicken yielded a good amount when it was cut, i wanted lashings, so i topped it up with some chicken stock and another good squeeze of lemon juice. again, whether you do this is entirely up to you. all i can promise is that if you make this chicken the way i did, it should be the best roast chicken you've ever had. oh, and by the way, although it's wonderfully flavoursome and succulent served hot - it's almost better cold because the garlicky lemony flavour seems to come out even more! did i mention i love this recipe? oh, shut up, kooka and tell the people how to make it!",

      "remove potatoes from the water to a plate until needed",
      "it doesn't matter if they get cold",
      "now , divide each bunch of herbs roughly into four: one quarter to go between the skin and the breast",
      "one quarter to go in the cavity",
      "one quarter to scatter over the chicken",
      "and one quarter reserved for garnish",
      "strip the leaves from one quarter of the oregano and one quarter of the thyme discarding any woody stalks",
      "leave the remaining herbs intact",
      "now , wash the cavity of the chicken with cold running water and dry the chicken very well , inside and out , with paper towels",
      "using a pair of kitchen shears or a sharp pair of scissors , trim the wing",
      "preheat your oven to 240c or 230c fan-forced and make sure there's a rack in the centre , or just below the centre and plenty of room above for the chicken",
      "place the chicken on a plate and , carefully , working from the neck end , slip your finger between the skin and the flesh on the right breast of the chicken , breaking through the membrane and separating the skin from the flesh , being careful not to pierce the skin with your fingernail",
      "try to wriggle your finger down near the drumstick and separate some of the skin from it too",
      "repeat for the left breast",
      "in a bowl , roughly mix together the butter cubes , the herb leaves you've stripped from their stalks , and the chopped , peeled garlic",
      "using your fingers , push this mixture carefully into the pockets you've formed between the skin and the flesh of the chicken breasts and , if possible , a little way down towards the drumsticks",
      "it doesn't matter if a bit falls out , you can just shove that into the cavity later",
      "put the chopped , unpeeled garlic and one , 'one-quarter' bunch each of the oregano and thyme into the cavity of the chicken",
      "you should now have two bunches each of the oregano and thyme left , and one bulb of unpeeled garlic cloves",
      "if using a large lemon , cut in half and squeeze the juice from one half only",
      "if using two small lemons , squeeze one whole lemon",
      "drizzle the lemon juice over the top of the chicken , and place the squeezed portion / s of the lemon into the cavity",
      "thinly slice the unsqueezed large lemon half , or whole small lemon , and set slices aside",
      "line a large baking pan with silicone paper",

      "place the sliced onion in the base of the pan and place the chicken on top",

      "it's supposed to look rustic ! they should look squashed but not flattened",
      "now , arrange the potatoes around the chicken in the baking pan and sprinkle them with salt and pepper , then drizzle the potatoes and the chicken generously with olive oil",
      "by all means use extra virgin olive oil if you like it , but it's not essential , ordinary olive oil will do",
      "finally , scatter the remaining herbs over the chicken and the potatoes",
      "spoon four tablespoons of water into the baking pan then place it into the pre-heated oven on the centre shelf",
      "roast for at 240c or 230c fan-forced , for about 50 minutes to 1 hour or until the chicken is cooked",
      "remove chicken from oven and place on a plate to rest for 10 minutes",
      "if potatoes are not quite crisp enough , place them in another pan and return to the oven while you prepare the sauce",
      "now , pick out any obviously burned bits or herb stalks from the baking pan , as well as the onion rings and any bits of lemon that have fallen off the chicken",
      "discard these bits",
      "using the back of a teaspoon , squash any unpeeled garlic cloves which are still soft and extract the soft garlic pulp from inside and discard the papery bits",
      "transfer the garlic pulp to a heat proof jug",
      "now , pour the drippings from the pan into the same jug",
      "don't worry if you haven't got a lot of liquid at this stage , you'll get quite a bit when you cut the chicken",
      "add the chicken stock to the jug",
      "allow this mixture to stand for a few minutes then skim or spoon the excess oil off the top",
      "now , check the potatoes if they're still in the oven and remove if ready , or leave them there if you want them even crispier",
      "now , dust off any burned bits of lemon , garlic or herbs on top of the chicken , divide the chicken into serving portions and pour off any liquid into the jug",
      "add extra lemon-juice , salt and pepper to the jug to taste",

      "prepare the achiote oil: in a saucepan , gently simmer the achiote seeds in the oil until the oil turns dark red",
      "remove from heat",
      "let cool",
      "strain the seeds from the oil and discard the seeds",
      "keep the cooled oil in a covered jar or other container",
      "you can leave it out , or refrigerate it",
      "you will use this oil in the \"masa\" , in the filling , and for wrapping the pasteles",
      "prepare the masa: cut the yuca into pieces that you can comfortably handle- about the size of a stick of butter",
      "carefully cut each piece lengthwise to reveal a woody stalk in the center of the yuca",
      "it's roughly the width of a toothpick , and runs the entire length",
      "cut it out by making a 'v' cut , and discard- we want our masa to be smooth !",
      "feed the pieces a little at a time into a food processor with grating blade- any stubborn pieces that hang around will be dealt with in the next step",
      "remove the grated yuca from the processor , switch the grating blade to the regular cutting blade , add the yuca back to the machine and pulse for about 2 - 3 minutes to create a moist , finely grated mixture that is the consistency of grated parmesan cheese- just a little wetter",
      "place the masa into a strainer that is lined with a cheesecloth",
      "place the strainer with the masa over a bowl , then cover with some plastic wrap , and place into the refrigerator until the next day when you are ready to finish the pasteles",
      "remove the masa from the refigerator",
      "it will have dripped several ounces of its liquid in the bowl- discard the liquid",
      "prepare the filling: wash the pork meat with vinegar",
      "cut the meat into inch cubes",
      "in a saucepan , use 2 ounces of the achiote oil that you prepared , and simmer the 2 ounces of sofrito in it on low heat for 3 -5 minutes",
      "add the rest of the filling ingredients to the saucepan , bring to a boil , lower the flame",
      "simmer for approximately 1 - 1 hours on low heat , covered",
      "take care that the water does not completely evaporate- if the sauce gets too thick , add a couple ounces of water",
      "the meat should be cooked , but it should not fall apart when done , so check every 15 minutes once an hour has passed",
      "when the meat is done , remove from heat and let cool",
      "you should have some gravy left with the meat , but it shouldn't be too watery",
      "if it looks dry , add 2 ounces of water",
      "in either case , now add the olive oil that was part of the last 3 ingredients",
      "while the meat is simmering , you can start seasoning the masa , but be sure and go back to the previous step to finish up the meat !",
      "season the masa: in a medium saucepan , on medium heat , use 2 ounces of the achiote oil that you prepared , and simmer the 1 cup of sofrito in it for approximately 5 minutes",
      "it should be sizzling slowly , not just steaming a little",
      "add the 2 ounces of water and the rest of the ingredients listed",
      "simmer another 5 minutes , then remove from heat",
      "in a large saucepan , bowl , or tray , add the masa that you had removed from the regrigerator",
      "now add the sofrito that you just removed from the heat , and mix well",
      "add a half cup of the achiote oil to this , and mix again",

      "if you haven't finished the last part of the meat , do so now",
      "otherwise , you're ready to wrap the pasteles !",
      "wrap the pasteles: use twenty bundles of plantain leaves",
      "with a knife , remove the central ridge of the plantain leaves to give greater flexibility to the leaves",
      "divide leaves into pieces , about 12 inches square",
      "wash and clean leaves with a damp cloth and toast slightly over an open flame",
      "this makes the leaf more pliable",
      "you should still have about cup of achiote oil left",
      "place 1 tsp of the achiote on the leaf , or the parchment paper",
      "spread it out to the size of a postcard",
      "next , place 3 tbsp of the masa on the leaf and spread it out thinly over the oil that you just spread out",
      "place 1 - 2 tbsp of the meat filling in the center of the masa",
      "place 2 olive halves on top of the masa",
      "place strip of red pepper on top of the masa",
      "fold the leaf one long half over towards the other",
      "it won't actually get to the other end , but you have created a top and bottom layer of plantain leaf and enclosed the contents in it",
      "now fold both of those back towards the end that you first started from , while keeping in mind that you are sort of duplicating the shape of the rectangle of oil that you first made !",
      "fold it once more , if you need to use up some paper",
      "then fold the right and left ends of the leaf toward the center",
      "tie the pasteles together in pairs , with a string , placing the folded edges facing each other",
      "they should be tied from both sides , to prevent them from opening",
      "this recipe yields approximately 12 -14 pasteles",
      "cook the pasteles: in large pot , bring to a boil 5 qts of water with 1tbsp salt",
      "add 12 pasteles and boil , covered , for one hour",

      "roll and spread the dough into one 13-inch or two 9-inch circles and place on a floured pizza peel",
      "if you are more comfortable working with one piece of dough at a time , you can shape and dress the second piece while the first is in the oven",
      "if making 2 pizzas , split all the topping measurements in half",
      "brush the dough with olive oil to within an inch of the edge , and spread the grated mozzarella to within 1 / 2 inch of the outer edge",
      "distribute the chicken over the cheese",
      "transfer the pizza to the oven and bake for 8 to 10 minutes , or until the crust is golden brown and the cheese at the center is melted and bubbly",

      "proceed as for the stand mixer making sure to stop kneading as soon as the dough forms a smooth ball",

, be sure to use the plastic blade , the metal knife will cut through the gluten strands and keep the dough from developing any \"body\"\nproceed as for the stand mixer making sure to stop kneading as

    "title": "kielbasa homemade kielbasa fresh polish sausage",
    "description": "posting as requested. we've perfected this recipe to our taste (very peppery and garlicky) over 20 years; my mother worked on it for years prior to that, even helping a polish friend make it for a little polish grocery store/butcher shop she owned. that said, we've found that it all works differently every year, depending on the quality of the meat, spices and casings. there's always some kind of problem! but it ends up remarkably consistent in taste. the directions are deliberately lengthy, the way i wrote them for a non-polish non-sausage-making friend. and they're a little informal here and there. but do read them through before you get into this project! prep time and sausage-making time are actually just a couple of hours each day for 2 days. we use an electric grinder which forces the meat through a horn into the casing. recipe #387079 is our favorite way to cook this kielbasa. make this 3-4 weeks ahead, wrap very well, and freeze in vac packs. you can also cook it before you freeze it; we don't. we've kept this in the deep-freeze for several months with no loss in quality. oh, and we call this fresh sausage because we don't smoke it. you certainly can do that, if you like the flavor.",

    ],
    "steps": [
      "put the garlic through a garlic press or mince really fine",
      "put the seasonings into a small pot with a pint of water",
      "boil and then cool",
      "here's where my mom always said taste it and i wouldn't",
      "that could account for the variance in taste from year to year !",
      "meanwhile , cut the pork off the bone",
      "cut into strips maybe 1\" by 3\"",
      "doesn't have to be exact size , we get pretty sloppy with it",
      "strips go through the grinder better than chunks",
      "don't trim anything off , unless you just can't stand not to",
      "trust me , if there's not enough fat , the kielbasa will be dry and hard",
      "do trim off any bloody-type stuff though",
      "we then put the meat into plastic dishpans , pour the cool liquid over , add about 4 cups ice cubes and mix together until your hands freeze",
      "it should be kinda sloppy",
      "if not , add more water or ice",
      "cover with aluminum foil or such and put in fridge over night to marinate so the meat soaks up the flavor",
      "stir occasionally",
      "the ice will probably all be melted the next day before you make the sausage",
      "the meat kind of absorbs the flavors",
      "yes , it will smell up the fridge",
      "in fact , it will smell up the whole house ! open the windows",
      "make the neighbors crazy !",
      "next day , take the casings out and soak in warm water for several hours",
      "it makes them more flexible",
      "cut in 4 ft",
      "lengths",
      "shove the meat in the freezer for 1 / 2 to 1 hour before you start",
      "the meat stiffens up a little and it's easier to put through the grinder",
      "stick one end of each casing on the faucet and run warm water through the inside of the casing",
      "ready ? this is the fun part",
      "put a little oil on your hand and run it over the horn where the meat will come out",
      "run casing through fingers to drain slightly",
      "put a casing on the horn",
      "one person helps push the meat through the grinder while the other holds the casing while it is filling up",
      "it kinda curls up as you hold it",
      "i find for me that it's better if i hold it up while it's filling , less pressure on the casing",
      "we make each one about 12-16\"",
      "or until it splits ! tie it off with string or knot the end if you can get it close to the end of the filled casing",
      "some people twist it every 6\" or so to make smaller sausages",
      "if the darn thing splits , you gotta scrape out the meat , dump it back with the other stuff in the dishpan and start over",
      "some years you're lucky , but some years the darn things split all the time",
      "that's one reason for soaking the casings for a longer time , they don't split as easily",
      "sometimes it's just a bad batch of casings",
      "then all you can do is swear at it",
      "we put the coils of sausage back into clean dishpans and put back into fridge to kinda dry overnight",
      "then we pack them in saran , aluminum foil , ziplock bags , anything that will keep the smell in , and put the packages in the freezer",
      "we make 2-3 lb",
      "packages",
      "since i have a vacuum sealer , i use that",
      "it works really great",
      "by the way , the sausage is pale because it is not smoked",
      "we don't care for smoked kielbasa",
      "but you can smoke it before freezing",
      "can't help you with that , though !",
      "we've been able to keep the sausage frozen for months",
      "just keep everything cold and clean while you're working",
      "keep a lot of paper towels handy to dry hands , answer the doggone telephone , etc",
      "we have found over the years , that pork has become much leaner now",
      "that is sometimes a problem",
      "we've considered buying more fat and mixing it in but never have",
      "it worked out all right just not cutting off any fat",
      "but insufficient fat makes for dry sausage",
      "it takes up about 1-1 / 2 hours altogether to fill the casings",
      "it's really simple and easy",
      "of course sometimes we have splashes on the walls when \"someone\" gets a little rough pushing the meat through the grinder",
      "hey , that's the fun of it",
      "it's a messy job , but someone has to do it",
      "oh yeah , the house smells for 3-4 days",
      "but it smells good",
      "if you like garlic",
      "all the seasonings are to your personal taste",
      "you really need a lot of salt though",
      "the pepper -- eh , how much do you like ? we like a lot",
      "same with the garlic",
      "we keep a little of the ground meat and cook a couple of small patties of the sausage",
      "that's when you can taste it and find out what you did wrong in the seasoning , too late , of course",
      "use the plate in the grinder which grinds the meat coarse",
      "it's better if the meat is a little chunky",
      "you don't want a mealy texture",
      "if you run a search on google , you can find other information under kielbasa",
      "one recipe i found says to knead meat and seasonings",
      "supposedly the more you knead , the more tender the sausage",
      "we've never tried that",
      "in recent years , we've set aside 3-4 lbs",
      "of the ground sausage meat and made it into small patties like breakfast sausage , and larger patties like hamburgers",

    "steps": [
      "1) spoon flour into a dry measuring cup and level off with the straight edge of a metal knife",
      "don't use a liquid measuring cup or you'll end up with too much flour and rock hard biscuits !",
      "2) i find it easier to incorporate room-temperature butter into my dry ingredients but then put the bowl with flour / butter back into the refrigerator for 10-15 minutes to chill the mixture",
      "the colder your butter is , the higher your biscuits will end up",
      "if you want to work with cold butter , this step is not necessary",
      "3) shake the carton of buttermilk before measuring and make sure the buttermilk is cold ! it keeps the butter cold , and you have a lighter , fluffier biscuit",
      "4) dust the work surface with all-purpose flour when rolling and shaping the dough",
      "5) cut straight down with a sharp biscuit cutter ! do not twist the cutter or you'll be sealing the edges of the biscuits and reduce the rise of them",
      "ditto on using a glass to cut out biscuits: both sides of the cutter need to be open to allow air to exit as you press down",
      "the glass ends up sealing the edges of the biscuit",
      "directions:",
      "preheat oven to 450-degrees f",
      "in a very large bowl combine all the dry ingredients: flour , baking powder , baking soda , sugar , salt , black pepper and cayenne pepper",
      "stir well to evenly distribute the ingredients",
      "drop the cut tablespoons of butter all around the flour mixture",
      "cut in butter using a pastry cutter until mixture is about the size of peas or very crumbly",
      "cover and chill in the refrigerator for 10-15 minutes to allow the butter to become hard",
      "this will aid in having a very flaky biscuit",
      "add the cheese chunks and chives to the chilled butter / flour mixture",
      "stir to coat them well with the flour",
      "stir in buttermilk only until dough holds together very slightly , about 30 seconds",
      "do not over stir ! this is the secret to incredibly fluffy and light biscuits ! the dough should \"hold together\" but still be very lofty and not packed down !",
      "turn dough out onto a floured board , kneading dough a few times and then pat into a 5-inch x 9-inch rectangle",
      "sprinkle top of dough with a small amount of additional flour and fold into thirds like a letter",
      "repeat entire process 2 more times , beginning with pressing into a 3 / 4\" inch-thick dough rectangle again",
      "press or pat dough into a 1 / 2 inch thickness on a lightly floured surface",
      "dip edges of 2",
      "5-inch biscuit cutter into flour and cut out a biscuit",
      "do not twist the cutter ! just press firmly down , once",
      "transfer to a parchment-lined baking sheet , placing biscuits side by side so they touch",
      "continue with existing dough",
      "with the scraps , very lightly press dough together to form another rectangle and continue cutting out the biscuits",
      "caution ! the more you work the dough and manhandle it , the tougher your biscuits will become so work with a very light hand when pushing the dough back together",
      "brush tops of biscuits lightly with cream",
      "bake for 14-16 minutes or until biscuits are lightly browned",
      "take out of oven by sliding the parchment paper with biscuits attached , onto table or counter top",
      "allow to sit for only 1 minute , and transfer to a wire rack to cool for only a couple of minutes before serving",
      "caution ! moisture really builds up on the bottom of these biscuits , which is why they only sit on the parchment paper for 1 minute",
      "cooling on the rack for 2-3 minutes allows the cheese to set enough that it does not burn a person's mouth when eating it !",
      "variations on biscuits:",
      "1) feta-oregano or marjoram: stir 4-8 ounces of crumbled feta cheese and 1 teaspoon of either oregano or marjoram into the chilled butter / flour mixture before adding the buttermilk",
      "proceed with recipe as directed",
      "2) bacon-cheddar: stir 6 cooked , drained , cooled and crumbled slices of bacon into the chilled butter / flour mixture along with 1 / 2 a cup of cubed cheddar cheese",
      "omit chives",
      "proceed with recipe as directed",
      "3) gruyere-rosemary: stir in 1 cup of cubed gruyere cheese and 1 / 2 tablespoon of fresh , snipped rosemary into the chilled butter / flour mixture",
      "use 1 / 4 cup of snipped chives and 1 / 2 tablespoon of freshly ground black peper",
      "proceed with recipe as directed",
      "4) havarti-dill: stir in 1 cup of cubed havarti cheese with 1 tablespoon of freshly snipped dill into the chilled butter / flour mixture",
      "omit chives",
      "proceed with recipe as directed",
      "5) pimento cheese: stir in 1 cup cubed sharp cheddar cheese with 1-4 ounce jar of drained and patted dry pimento into the chilled butter / flour mixture",
      "omit chives",
      "proceed with recipe as directed",
      "6) the one failure that i had was with pepperjack cheese",
      "the actual cheese is too mild to taste in the end results and the remaining hot peppers were too much for the biscuit",
      "avoid this combination !"

this is the secret to incredibly fluffy and light biscuits ! the dough should \"hold together\" but still be very lofty and not packed down !\nturn dough out onto a floured board , kneading dough a few times and then pat into a 5-inch x 9-inch rectangle\nsprinkle top of dough with a small amount of additional flour and fold into thirds like a letter\nrepeat entire process 2 more times , beginning with pressing into a 3 / 4\" inch-thick dough rectangle again\npress or pat dough into a 1 / 2 inch thickness on a lightly floured surface\ndip edges of 2\n5-inch biscuit cutter into flour and cut out a biscuit\ndo not twist the cutter ! just press firmly down , once\ntransfer to a parchment-lined baking sheet , placing biscuits side by side so they touch\ncontinue with existing dough\nwith the scraps , very lightly press dough together to form another rectangle and continue cutting out the biscuits\ncaution ! the more you work the dough and manhandle it , the tougher your biscuits will become so work with a very light hand when pushing the dough back together\nbrush tops of biscuits lightly with cream\nbake for 14-16 minutes or until biscuits are lightly browned\ntake out of oven by sliding the parchment paper with biscuits attached , onto table or counter top\nallow to sit for only 1 minute , and transfer to a wire rack to cool for only a couple of minutes before serving\ncaution ! moisture really builds up on the bottom of these biscuits , which is why they only sit on the parchment paper for 1 minute\ncooling on the rack for 2-3 minutes allows the cheese to set enough that it does not burn a person's mouth when eating it !\nvariations on biscuits:\n1) feta-oregano or marjoram: stir 4-8 ounces of crumbled feta cheese and 1 teaspoon of either oregano or marjoram into the chilled butter / flour mixture before adding the buttermilk\nproceed with recipe as directed\n2) bacon-cheddar: stir 6 cooked , drained , cooled and crumbled slices of bacon into the chilled butter / flour mixture along with 1 / 2 a cup of cubed cheddar cheese\nomit chives\nproceed with recipe as directed\n3) gruyere-rosemary: stir in 1 cup of cubed gruyere cheese and 1 / 2 tablespoon of fresh , snipped rosemary into the chilled butter / flour mixture\nuse 1 / 4 cup of snipped chives and 1 / 2 tablespoon of freshly ground black peper\nproceed with recipe as directed\n4) havarti-dill: stir in 1 cup of cubed havarti cheese with 1 tablespoon of freshly snipped dill into the chilled butter / flour mixture\nomit chives\nproceed with recipe as directed\n5) pimento cheese: stir in 1 cup cubed sharp cheddar cheese with 1-4 ounce jar of drained and patted dry pimento into the chilled butter / flour mixture\nomit chives\nproceed with recipe as directed\n6) the one failure that i had was with pepperjack cheese\nthe actual cheese is too mild to taste in the end results and the remaining hot peppers were too much for the biscuit\navoid this combination !\nTags:\n60-minutes-or-less\ntime-to-make\ncourse\npreparation\noccasion\nbreads\nrolls-biscuits\ndietary\nhigh-calcium\nhigh-in-something\ntaste-mood\nsavory",

    "description": "i only had a few meyer lemons from my first crop, and i wanted to make the best marmalade. i found this recipe on simple recipes and i certainly got the best tasting marmalade i ever tasted. the mixture of the lemon/orange taste really makes this different than the straight orange.here is the site to review for the pictures, the complete recipe is here without the pictures. http://simplyrecipes.com/recipes/meyer_lemon_marmalade this recipe calls for meyer lemons, a hybrid of a regular lemon and an orange, that is thinner skinned and sweeter than a regular lemon. you cannot substitute regular lemons for meyer lemons in this recipe. i followed the recipe, and it came out perfect.",

    "ingredients": [
      "meyer lemons",
      "water",
      "granulated sugar"
    ],
    "steps": [
      "so if you don't have a kitchen scale and don't weigh your lemons to begin with , as you proceed through this recipe keep in mind these proportions",
      "your 2 1 / 2 lbs of lemons should yield 6 cups of chopped lemon",
      "6 cups of chopped lemon will be cooked first with 6 cups of water , and then later 6 cups of sugar are added",
      "you can also do this recipe with 4 cups of chopped lemons , 4 cups of water , and 4 cups of sugar",
      "do not double the recipe",
      "do not reduce the sugar",
      "the sugar is needed for the jelly to set",
      "preparing the fruit",
      "scrub the lemons clean",
      "discard any that are moldy or damaged",
      "prepare the lemons",
      "cut 1 / 4 inch off from the ends of the lemons",
      "working one at a time , stand a lemon on end",
      "cut the lemon in half lengthwise",
      "cut each lemon half into several segments , lengthwise",
      "as you cut the lemons into segments , if you can , pull off any exposed membranes",
      "just get the ones that are easy to get to , ignore the rest",
      "when you've cut down to the final segment , cut away the pithy core",
      "remove all seeds from the segments",
      "reserve the seeds and any removed membrane or pith",
      "you will need them to make pectin",
      "cut each lemon segment crosswise into even pieces to make little triangles of lemon peel and pulp",
      "put all of the seeds , membranes and pith you removed from the lemons into a bag fashioned out of two layers of cheesecloth or a muslin jelly bag",
      "first stage of cooking",
      "place the lemon segments and water into a large , wide pot",
      "place the pectin bag in the pot with the fruit pulp and secure to the pot handle",
      "bring mixture to a medium boil on medium high heat",
      "let boil , uncovered , for about 25-35 minutes , until the peels are soft and cooked through",
      "test one of the lemon peel pieces by eating it",
      "it should be soft",
      "if it is still chewy , keep cooking until soft",
      "remove from heat",
      "remove the pectin bag , place the pectin bag in a bowl and let cool until it is comfortable to touch",
      "add the pectin and sugar",
      "once your pectin bag has cooled to the point you can handle it , if you want , squeeze it like play-doh to extract any extra pectin",
      "this is not necessary but will help ensure a good set",
      "you should be able to get a tablespoon or two more from the bag",
      "it has the consistency of sour cream",
      "return this pectin to the pan with the lemon mixture",
      "measure out your sugar and add it to the pan with the lemon mixture",
      "second stage of cooking",
      "heat the jelly mixture on medium high and bring it to a rapid boil",
      "secure a candy thermometer to the side of the pan",
      "the marmalade may take anywhere from 20 to 35 minutes or so to be ready to pour out",
      "after about 15 minutes , start checking it frequently",
      "there are two ways to test that the marmalade is ready to pour out into jars - the mixture reaching a temperature of 220-222f and a bit of it put on a chilled plate \"wrinkling up\" when you push it with your finger",
      "i do both",
      "for the wrinkle test , put several small plates into the freezer",
      "as the jelly temperature reaches 218f , start testing it by placing a small amount of the hot jelly on a chilled plate",
      "if the jelly spreads out and thins immediately , it isn't ready",
      "if it holds its shape a bit , like an egg yolk , that's a good sign",
      "push up against it with your finger",
      "if the jelly sample wrinkles at all , it is time to take the jelly off the heat and pour it out into jars",
      "when you use a candy thermometer to test the temperature of your mixture , make sure the probe is not touching the bottom of the pan",
      "make sure that the indentation on the probe is actually surrounded by the mixture",
      "this may mean that you have to tilt the pan to one side , to cover the probe sufficiently to get a good reading",
      "canning",
      "while the marmalade is in its second cooking stage , rinse out your canning jars , dry them , and place them , without lids , in a 200f oven",
      "they should be in the oven at least 10 minutes before using them",
      "as the time approaches for the marmalade to be done , boil some water in a tea pot",
      "put the jar lids in a glass or ceramic bowl and pour the boiling water over them to sterilize",
      "once the jelly has reached 220f or its \"wrinkly\" stage , remove the jelly pot from the heat",
      "carefully ladle the jelly into the jars , one at a time , leaving 1 / 4 inch head space at the top of the jars for a vacuum seal",
      "wipe the rim clean with a clean , wet paper towel",
      "place the lid on the jar , securing with a jar ring",
      "work quickly",
      "allow the jars to sit overnight",
      "you will hear them make a popping sound as a vacuum seal is created",
      "even if the jelly is not firm as it goes into the jar , it should firm up as it cools"

      "then cut it in inches wide strips , and separate them a little",

      "as the cabbage is cooking , you can get started on the other vegetables",
      "first the carrots",
      "peel them and cut them in 1 / 3 of an inch slices",
      "reserve",
      "wash the leeks",
      "leeks need to be really washed thoroughly",
      "first remove the first couple of peels , cut the dark green hard part of and trim the roots",
      "then cut them in half , almost all the way , but leaving the bottom inch still attached",
      "wash them really well , check each leaf on both sides for dirt",
      "then chop them 2 / 3 of an inch thick chunks",
      "put them in a colander , and separate them , under running water to be safe for dirt",
      "reserve",
      "now chop some bacon in half inch thick chunks",
      "i use about 6-7 slices of bacon , but you can use more if you like",
      "just don't use less , we need both the fat the bacon is going to release , and the flavor as a base for the cabbage",
      "just before you actually start cooking the dish , rinse the pot you cooked the cabbage in , put your potatoes in , lukewarm water , cover and put to boil",
      "when it boils , add 2 cubes of knorr vegetable bouillon cube , and salt liberally",
      "once it comes to a boil , pre-cook them for 20 minutes , then remove from the heat and leave in the scalding water untill you're ready for them",
      "now we are actually ready to start cooking",
      "start the bacon it in the braisier with a little olive oil on medium heat to get it started",
      "once its starting to become golden , remove it from the pan with a slotted spoon and reserve",
      "in the same fat , add half a tbsp of lard and saute the carrots on medium heat with a little salt",
      "cover for 5-10 minutes , toss , cover again , for another 5-10 minutes , until they are starting to become golden",
      "remove from the pan with a slotted spoon and reserve",
      "in the same fat , lower the heat to medium low , toss in the leeks , with a tbsp of butter , salt and pepper , and cover it until it begins to melt , about 10 minutes",
      "add the cabbage and the bacon back in the pan and toss everything together until its mixed well",
      "push it a little to make room for the 2 sausages , and hide the carrots behind the barrier made by the sausages",
      "i use hillshire farm",
      "taste the cabbage for salt",
      "then cover with 2 cups of beef stock",
      "when i don't have time to make my own , i use kitchen basics beef stock , because as its low in sodium , it allows me to control the salt",
      "now peel the potatoes , and nest them well in the cabbage so they can suck up all the flavors",
      "if you have extra potatoes you can put the extra ones on top of the sausages too",
      "turn the heat to low , now its simmer time",

      "check the cabbage for salt and rectify if necessary",
      "uncover , turn the heat up to medium / medium low , and let the beef stock reduce almost all the way through",
      "slice the sausage and put it back in the braisier",
      "serve with dijon mustard",
      "enjoy !",
      "it's one of these vegetables that need a long cooking time to develop their sweetness and be good",
      "the entire dish would be \"cooked\" per-se , an hour and a half earlier , but it needs that extra hour and a half , basting every 30 minutes , for the cabbage to taste right and the potatoes to absorb all the flavors of the dish",
      "the more you cook this dish , the better it will get",
      "it's also a great dish to make a day in advance and reheat covered on very low heat",
      "in this case , stop it at the \"pause\" stage , when you uncover it and let the beef stock reduce for half an hour",
      "it will finish reducing as you re-heat it , only , you would keep it covered first until it starts to simmer"

    "description": "first, don't let the long list of instructions turn you away . . . it's very simple! this is my version of artisan bread in five minutes a day (by jeff hertzberg and zoe francois), a revolutionary approach to bread baking. actually it's a combination of five minute bread and cook's illustrated recipe #290761. perfect answer to a busy life . . mix once and store in the refrigerator. (see list below of other uses for this recipe). when you're ready to bake take out the amount of pre-mixed dough needed and store the rest in the refrigerator for up to 10 days. the flavor will be similar to sourdough, developing more intensely over the days of storage. preparation time indicated does not include pre-fermentation time, which can vary from 3 hours to 10 days. special equipment needed: large (5 - 6 qt.) plastic container with lid (not air tight) and a baking stone or a 5 qt. dutch oven (depending on your choice of baking methods). i've found that it's best to line a basket or bowl with parchment paper; let the bread rise, and then back in a preheated dutch oven. note that the beer used in this recipe must be a lager; do not use an ale as they use a different type of fermentation. do not use glass jars with screw tops (they could explode from the trapped gases).lidded plastic buckets designed for dough storage are readily available -- i purchased mine through king arthur flour. other ideas for use: pita bread: recipe #310219 lavash: recipe #310451 baguette: recipe #317472",

      "you willl get a more accurate measurement",
      "in large plastic storage container mix together the flour , yeast and salt",
      "add all the liquid at once and mix with a wooden spoon",
      "if mixing becomes too difficult to incorporate all the flour with the spoon , reach into the mixing bowl with very wet hands and press the mixture together",
      "when everything is uniformly moist without dry patches your mixing is complete",
      "this should take only a few minutes",
      "the dough will be wet and loose enough to conform to the shape of its container",
      "cover with a lid that fits well on the container",
      "allow the mixture to rise at room temperature until it begins to collapse , or at least flattens on the top , about 2 hours , depending on the room's temperature and the initial water temperature",
      "longer rising times , up to about 5 hours , will not harm the result",
      "you can use a portion of the dough anytime after this period",
      "fully refrigerated wet dough is less sticky and easier to work with than dough at room temperature",
      "so the first time you try this method , it's best to refrigerate the dough overnight , or at least 3 hours , before shaping a loaf",
      "the breads flavor improves with the retardation , so suggest you wait at least 24 hours before baking the first loaf ! dough may be stored in the refrigerator for up to 10 days",
      "to bake boule :",
      "first , prepare a pizza peel by sprinkling it liberally with cornmeal to prevent the loaf from sticking",
      "with wet hands , pull up one end of the refrigerated dough",
      "using a serrated knife , cut off a 1-pound , or grapefruit-size , piece of dough",
      "hold the mass of dough in your hands",

      "gently stretch the surface of the dough on all four sides , rotating the ball a quarter-turn as you go",
      "most of the dusting flour will fall off",
      "the bottom of the loaf may appear to be a collection of bunched ends , but they will flatten out during resting and baking",

      "now it's decision time , which method to use for baking",
      "covered pot method:",
      "cover loosely with plastic wrap and let rise at room temperature until dough has doubled in size and does not readily spring back when poked with finger , about 60 - 90 minutes",
      "about 30 minutes before baking , adjust oven rack to lowest position , place 6- to 8-quart heavy-bottomed dutch oven on rack , and heat oven to 450 degrees",
      "lightly flour top of dough and , using razor blade or sharp knife , make one 6-inch-long , 1 / 2-inch-deep slit along top of dough",

      "this prevent the bottom from burning",
      "to assure that the bottom does not burn , i also place the pot on a heat diffuser",

      "preheat oven to 450 degrees 20 minutes before baking",
      "spray top of dough with cold water",
      "use a serrated bread knife to slash a 1 / 4-inch-deep cross or tic-tac-toe pattern onto the top",
      "slide the loaf off the pizza peel onto the preheated baking stone using a quick , forward jerking motion",
      "if using parchment just lift off peel and place on stone",
      "pour 1 cup hot water into the broiler tray and close oven door to trap steam",
      "bake about 30-35 minutes , or until the crust is nicely browned and sounds hollow when tapped",

    "description": "italian rum cake is a delicious 3 or 4 layer cake, which is a tradition for birthdays/special occasions in many italian families. there are 3 basic parts to the cake; sponge cake layers, pasticciera cream (filling) and (stabilized) whipped cream. below are the recipes for all three parts. if you make it with 3 layers, omit the whipped cream layer. the sponge cake and pasticciera creams may be made a day ahead. the whipped cream should be whipped just before assembling the cake. prep/cook times do not include the 3-4 hour chilling time for the pasticciera cream. please note: this is an egg leavened cake! the egg yolks and whites must be beaten to the correct volume and consistency or the recipe will not work. also, the other ingredients must be folded in (beaten whites folded into the yolk/sugar mixture not the other way around) in the order given in the directions or the cake will not turn out. the finished layers will be thin depending on the size of your pan. the smaller the pan, the thicker the layers and the longer the baking time needed. if you are expecting this cake to turn out like a \"génoise or american sponge cake,\" you will be disappointed as this is not a génoise sponge recipe.",

      "they also give you an amazing stencil to use to cut out your cookie shapes and then later they're great for preventing any mess when you're pouring candy glass windows into your finished cookies",
      "in a stand mixer beat butter and sugar until creamy , add molasses and eggs",
      "in another bowl , mix all dry ingredients",
      "once done slowly mix into wet ingredients and stir until dough ball forms",

      "using flour to prevent sticking",
      "cut out shapes using homemade stencils and save scraps for the next sheet",

      "large cookies can take 18 minutes and small decorative pieces can be done in as little as 5 minutes",
      "so keep an eye on them",
      "once baked , remove from oven (and here's my secret to getting a smooth cookie -- immediately after removing a batch from the oven , place a sheet of parchment over the top and using a slightly smaller baking sheet press , slide and swivel the smaller sheet on top until perfect",
      "allow cookies to cool before removing and place on paper towels",
      "do any candy glass windows before assembling",
      "advice and pointers: assembling is my personal favorite part , but be sure to have a lot of patience and go slowly",
      "don't let go of any pieces unless you're positive they're secure and if you're unsure , use various kitchen items as supports -- things get pretty jenky in my kitchen during this process",
      "know that cookies will break here and there , make extra of critical pieces if you have the time and keep in mind you're doing something fun and when things go wrong , it's just a lesson for the future -- at least that's what i tell myself when i'm facing a kitchen catastrophe :d",
      "candy glass:",
      "mix sugar , water , corn syrup and tartar in a large pot on medium / high heat",
      "stir constantly until mixture begins to boil",
      "stop stirring and place candy thermometer on the edge of the pot with the temp gauge submerged into sugar syrup",
      "this part takes forever so set up a chair next to the stove and grab a magazine / book / laptop and keep an eye on the thermometer",
      "allow to heat to 300 degrees and immediately remove from heat",
      "stir and mix in two drops blue food coloring",
      "have cookies clean and resting face up on a very flat surface covered in a aluminum foil",
      "use your cardboard stencil over your cookie and pour candy glass into your cutouts using a bent tea spoon or small ladle",
      "once poured , immediately lift stencil off and clear any sugar strands that occur",
      "advice and pointers: this is one of those things you should set a lot of time aside for and prepare yourself with a lot of patience",
      "having a plate warmer to set the pot of hot sugar on near your workstation is a great way to give yourself a bit more time to work with each batch",
      "depending on how many windows you have to do , you'll be needing to make several batches",
      "as soon as one batch begins to harden , you need to cut your losses and discard it",
      "this stuff is also insanely hot so be very careful and make sure no pets , children or other obstacles are around when working with candy glass !",
      "royal icing for gingerbread castle:",
      "in a stand mixer beat egg whites till frothy and incorporate sugar until smooth",
      "then mix in the rest of the ingredients little bits at a time until the color you desire is achieved",

      "brown / sear the meatballs while continually rolling them with the utensils of your choice",
      "i use two wooden spoons , but i've also used tongs to do this",

      "however , they need to be done well enough to stick mostly together for slicing",
      "i think next time i may chill them in the refrigerator",

      "this recipe is about shortcuts , not making things from scratch",

      "here is the product link:",
      "boil the lasagna noodles to just below al dente",
      "what worked for me as a guess was one minute shorter than the lowest recommended time - this was 9 minutes for the mueller brand noodles that were on sale for 2:1 the day i was shopping for supplies for this project",
      "the noodle layers will also soften while the lasagna is cooking , so do not worry if they are a little stiff",
      "if using meat , remove the meatballs from the sauce and slice into roughly inch slices",

      "1",
      "soak the hog casings in 4 cups tepid water overnight in the fridge",
      "some sausage experts may disagree but i soak the casings overnight and then , prior to stuffing them , i add about 1 tablespoon of cider vinegar per cup of water and let the casings soak for the final 15 minutes",
      "i have found that the vinegar makes the casings more pliable and translucent",
      "2",
      "rinse the casings thoroughly inside and out",
      "begin stuffing right away since the casings may become tough or burst if you let them dry too much",
      "the stuffing:",
      "1",
      "cut the pork meat and the pork belly into very small cubes",
      "this is the longest and most tiring part but dont be lazy",
      "the more uniform your cubes are , the better the mixture will blend and the more evenly your chorizo will cook",
      "please , do not grind the meat !",
      "2",
      "put the cubed meat in a large bowl and mix it well",
      "3",
      "add the finely chopped cilantro and green onions and mix well",
      "4",
      "add the rest of the ingredients",
      "mix well with your hands",
      "5",
      "finally , start adding the water gradually and mixing it with your hands",
      "i normally add two cups , mix it and then add more water until the mixture becomes sticky but not runny",
      "continue to hand-mix for approximately ten minutes to make sure that the water is fully incorporated into the mixture",
      "6",
      "this is where some other experts may also disagree but i let the stuffing mixture sit in the fridge overnight , covered",
      "i honestly think that this allows all of the flavors to really soak into the meats and bring out the unique colombian flavor in the chorizos",
      "7",
      "tie one end of the casing in a knot",
      "i dont like to use thread because it gets stuck between my teeth",
      "stuff the casings and tie the other end",
      "to make the links , i simply twist the stuffed casing two or three times every six inches or so",
      "stuffing is one of those trial-and-error kinds of things",
      "too tight and you may burst the casing as you twist it into links",
      "too loose and your chorizo will get all wrinkly and have air pockets all over the place",
      "i usually stuff one end of the casing fairly full and then very lightly at the other end",
      "this way , i can start twisting from the heavy end , twist and allow the mixture to move along the length of the casing and fill in the light end",
      "8",
      "after the links are done , use a pin or needle to poke three or four holes on each side of the link",
      "this prevents bursting while cooking",
      "9",
      "the final step is yet one more with which the experts may disagree",
      "however , i most assuredly remember that all of the restaurants i visited as a child that served chorizo , cured the links for approximately three days",
      "my curing consists simply of hanging the chorizos as horizontally as possible from hooks around the bay window frame in my butler pantry",
      "if you decide to cure them , make sure that you place paper towels or newspaper on the sill to catch the drippings",
      "allowing the chorizos to dangle vertically will probably result in the twisted links unraveling somewhat",
      "10",
      "storage: my family loves chorizos so i really do not have to worry too much about storage",
      "however , on the couple of occasions where i had to store a few links , they will keep perfectly in the refrigerator for up to 20 days",
      "i have also frozen some of them and have had no problems thawing them out and using them normally",
      "cooking:",
      "1",
      "my favorite cooking method is to put the links in a frying pan with enough water to reach about half way up the prone link",
      "turn your burner to low and allow the chorizo to cook slowly until all the water has evaporated , turning occasionally so all sides cook evenly",
      "after the water has evaporated , the chorizo will look kind of whitish and opaque",
      "continue to fry until dark brown",
      "the fat from the chorizo mixture will escape through the pin holes and will provide enough of a frying medium so that you do not have to add oil or any other frying agent",
      "2",
      "other methods include cooking them over charcoal , on your gas grill , boiled , skewered over a wood fire and , of course , cut into chunks as part of lentil soup and other dishes",
      "whatever method you choose , remember that chorizo should be cooked slowly and gently to avoid bursting the casings",
      "please come back in the future as i plan to soon upload my recipe for sancocho which , of course , includes lots of chorizo"

    "description": "before you run screaming the other way, trust me when i say that this cake is absolutely incredible. don’t let the word “vegan” put you off… this cake is every bit as decadent as its fat-and-calorie-filled cousins. i’ve sampled my fair share of vegan cakes, and this is by far one of the best! note: if you use water-packed tofu for the filling/frosting, the tofu needs to strain for 24 hours. if you use the aseptic tofu, the filling may need to chill for 1-6 hours before being usable, so make the filling/frosting the day before baking the cake. i personally prefer the aseptic tofu to the water-packed tofu; it has a better texture and less bean flavor.",

      "\"preheat the oven to 375f",
      "cut each baby eggplant in half , keeping the stem end intact and going straight to the tail",
      "use one tablespoon of oil to brush liberally over the eggplants , both front and back , before laying them cut side up on a baking sheet",
      "tuck the oiled eggplant halves in the oven for approximately 20 minutes , or until the flesh is soft and easily pierced with a fork but the bodies have not collapsed",
      "while the eggplant are baking up , its a perfect time to toast the pine nuts",
      "spread the nuts out on an ungreased baking sheet in a single layer",
      "tuck them in the oven for 3-5 minutes , shaking the pan halfway through",
      "when the pine nuts are mostly golden brown they are toasted and ready",

      "put it into a heatproof container and pour the boiling water over top",
      "sprinkle liberally with salt and let it stand for 15 minutes",

      "you could let the bulghar soak for as long as 30 minutes , but i like to drain it after 15 so that it is still a touch al dente",
      "after all , when the bulgar is added to the tomato mixture and baked it will continue to soak up moisture so it shouldnt be mushy soft",

      "life is pretty good",
      "chop the onions into a small , thin mince and finely mince the garlic",

      "starting the onions and garlic off in a cold pan will encourage them to deepen and sweeten without as much risk of burning",
      "after 5-7 minutes when the onions are a pale gold color add the diced tomatoes , honey and dried spices",
      "okay , so i totally didnt use diced tomatoes here",
      "i used whole canned tomatoes , because i love to squish them into a pulp in my hands before adding them to the pan",
      "we all have our quirky little habits , and that just happens to be one of mine",
      "give this a stir and turn the heat down slightly to medium low",
      "you will need to cook the tomato mixture for at least 7-10 minutes , stirring fairly regularly , or until the liquid has reduced significantly in the pan",
      "are the eggplants soft ? as soon as they are cool enough to handle , use a small paring knife to score all around the edges of the eggplant , leaving a skin which is about 1 / 4 thick",
      "carefully scoop out the flesh which needs to be given a good chop",
      "when the tomato mixture has thickened enough that you can run a spoon through it and still see the bottom of the pan 5 seconds later , add the chopped eggplant flesh and stir it through",
      "let this cook for a minute or two so that the flavors can combine",
      "finely chop the mint and parsley leaves",
      "there should be slightly more mint than parsley , but be generous with both",
      "reserve one tablespoon of the chopped herbs to use as garnish",
      "take the pan off the heat before adding the bulgar to the tomatoes , along with the pine nuts , mint and parsley",
      "stir everything together , squeeze in the juice of 1 / 2 lemon , and season quite generously with salt and pepper",
      "you cant afford to be shy with the seasoning in a bulgar dish",
      "spoon the stuffing into your gutted eggplant halves , pressing it together and really mounding it inches your cupped palm is the best tool that you could have to keep the mixture in a pseudo-dome shape as you press it into the shells",
      "bake the eggplant for 15-20 minutes , or until they are warmed through and the tops are just starting to brown",
      "sprinkle the eggplant with your reserved chopped parsley and mint , and serve with a bowl of black olives and some fresh pita bread on the side",
      "the sultry cinnamon and allspice , combined with smoky nutmeg and just a mere whiff of heat from the chili are enough to elevate a simple bulgar and tomato stuffing into the realm of the exotic in a non-intimidating way",

      "to mix by hand , in a large mixing or mixer bowl , blend 2 cups of the flour with salt and sugar",
      "dissolve yeast in warm water and add it and the warmed milk and half-and-half to the flour mixture",
      "stir with a wooden spoon or the flat blade of an electric mixer to thoroughly blend the batterlike dough , about 2 minutes",
      "stir in additional flour , 1 / 4 cup at a time , to make a soft but not sticky dough knead by hand or under a dough hook for 5 minutes to form a solid mass",
      "if using a food processor , attach the steel blade",
      "place 2 cups flour in the work bowl and add the dry ingredients",

      "add the balance of the flour , 1 / 2 cup at a time , turning the machine on briefly after each addition",
      "when the mixture forms a mass and begins to clean the sides of the bowl , knead for 30 seconds",
      "don't overknead !",
      "this begins the process of cooling the dough and at the same time allowing it to rise",
      "cover the bowl with plastic wrap and place in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour",
      "determine that both butter and dough are about the same temperature 65f is ideal",
      "the block of butter should bend but not break nor be oily when bent slightly",

      "with a heavy rolling pin , roll the dough into a rectangle , approximately 8\" x 18\"",
      "this dimension is not critical",
      "caution: if the butter seems to be breaking into small pieces under the dough rather than remaining solid , allow the dough / butter to warm a few minutes",

      "remove the dough from the refrigerator and place on the floured work surface",
      "unwrap , roll out , and fold in thirds , as for a letter",
      "this is the final turn before it is rolled out and cut into croissants",
      "dampen cloth again and wrap loosely around the dough",
      "place the package in a plastic bag so moisture will be retained",
      "leave in the refrigerator 4 to 6 hours or overnight",
      "mix together the egg and 1 tbsp of water",
      "have ready the egg wash , a knife or pastry cutter , and a wooden yardstick if you wish the pieces to be cut precisely otherwise , plan to cut them freehand",
      "you may have or can borrow a french croissant cutter that cuts the dough into triangles",

      "the best will disappear first",
      "do not freeze",
      "pick out a nice thick slab checking the sides to make sure it isn't a very gristly one",
      "feel it because some butchers fold it over hiding the gristle if there is a lot of it",
      "there will always be some gristle and it runs the length of the slab in the center",
      "the thicker the slab the better",
      "if you are lucky , you may see some chunk style at a higher price per pound",
      "if there isn't a spice bag in with the brisket , you will need to get some whole peppercorns and bay leaves",
      "------------selecting the cabbage-------------------",
      "the heavier and more solid it is , the better it is",
      "smell it to make sure it isn't too bitter",

      "i have had to visit several stores to find a decent batch",
      "keep in mind that the outer leaves will be discarded even if the store has already removed the natural outer leaves to make them look better and fresher",
      "--------------selecting the potatoes----------------",
      "watch out for the red dyed ones",
      "pick out a bag of medium to small sized ones",
      "the smaller the better",
      "if you are lucky enough to find the ones as small as salad tomatoes , they are the best",
      "-------------selecting the carrots----------",
      "get the smallest bag they have unless you like carrots , because you will only use one per pot of cabbage to take any bitterness out of the cabbage",

      "use a large dutch oven or stock pot that will hold everything all at once",

      "after the 2 hours----------------------",
      "add the potatoes on top of the brisket",
      "add water to cover everything",
      "bring to a boil",
      "reduce heat , cover and simmer for 10 minutes",

      "check the cabbage to see if it is tender",

    "title": "jane s challah bread using food processor",
    "description": "this is a traditional jewish bread although most cultures have a similar type of bread. it is slightly sweet and eggy. it is traditionally formed into a braid, but can also be baked in a loaf pan (for easier slicing). this recipe makes 2 16 ounce loaves (notice that these loaves are slightly smaller than typical recipes). the smaller size works best in my food processor and i find it is the preferred size of my farmer's market customers. it makes great french toast. it is also an excellent base recipe for sweet breads (cinnamon raisin swirl, pecan rolls, etc.) i use a 14 cup cuisinart food processor to make all my breads but the recipe could be adapted to a bread machine, stand mixer, or made by hand. although the steps look long and involved, i have written them for the novice bread baker -- so i have included a lot of detail. the time to make is just an estimate.",

    "title": "very berry bread pudding",
    "description": "it's said that \"necessity is the mother of invention,\" and that's how my version of bread pudding was created. i had never made one prior to having guests for dinner that requested a bread pudding for dessert. \"no problem!\", i thought, \"how hard can it be to make?\" i chose a classic betty crocker recipe, made it, served it, and couldn't eat more than a spoonful! my guests had no problem with it but for me, it was boring, mediocre and didn't hold my interest. because my family refuses to eat raisins and i was so sorely disappointed in the original recipe, i spent a week with my cookbooks, pouring over them and taking notes from various recipes. i ultimately decided to treat each aspect of the bread pudding as a single unit: if i'd love to eat the custard, alone, than it was a winner. same went for the bread: if it was such a great bread that i could eat it plain, then it had to be included. and since raisins were out, i decided to use mixed berries as a contrast against the custardy bread filling. and what came out of the oven was a winner! because the pudding is so creamy and slightly sweet, the sharp tang of the berries just zipped right through the sweetness and burst onto your tongue, making you almost draw in your breath from the delicious contrast. then, add the orange-flavoured whipped cream, which added another layer of distinct flavour to it, and it was a hit...in our home! is this the most economical bread pudding, using scraps of this and that? no. is this the simplest of bread pudding recipes to create, dumping stale bread and milk together, toss in an egg or two, a handful of raisins and into the oven? no, again. but, this is a bread pudding that will make you proud to serve it at your table. it's a bread pudding that treated each element with the respect that it deserved, creating a quality dessert. so, if you want a slightly more upscale version of a bread pudding that is sure to wow your family, please try my version, that will become our standard from now on. and yes!, the temperature is correct: it's 335 degrees; i split the difference between 325 for custard and 350 for cake. this way, the bread browns nicely but the custard doesn't overbake. enjoy!",

      "no oil , no seasoning , just put them in the oven",

      "then i add in the flour and stir well to combine",
      "cook just another minute then add in the broth and cook about 10 minutes until the vegetables , especially the potatoes are soft",

    "description": "spend 5-10 minutes mixing water, flour, yeast & salt in a big plastic container on the weekend, and then shape & bake small loaves each morning for the rest of the week good for 2 sandwiches each. no kneading. you need a digital scale to make measuring ingredients super easy and a 6qt (shoe-box sized) container to hold the dough in the fridge. this is essentially the basic recipe from \"artisan bread in 5 minutes a day\" with a few modifications based on experimentation, ideas from other cook books and measurement converted to weight. i've made it even less work and a little cheaper, but definitely check out the book for more variations and ideas!",

      "all-purpose flour",
      "yeast",
      "table salt"
    ],
    "steps": [
      "start by putting 700g water in a 6qt container with a lid",
      "just make sure it's not a screw-top container , because you want it to be able to pop off if the dough really expands or gases build up inside",
      "but you don't want the dough to dry out during the long rise time , so you want something with a decent seal to keep in the moisture",
      "sprinkle a tablespoon of salt and 4-8 g of yeast on top",
      "the warmer it is inside where you are going to set the dough to rise , the less yeast you need",
      "in the summer i use 4g , and the winter 8g",
      "great for stretching that pricey jar of yeast as far as it will go !",
      "dump 1000g of unbleached all-purpose flour on top of that and mix it up with a big spoon just until all the flour is damp",
      "don't knead ! it's very sticky at this point , but still , more of a lump than a batter",
      "cover and let it sit out on the counter all day or all night , until you can see big bubbles in the dough through the clear sides of the container and the container is almost full",
      "for me this usually takes 6-12 hours",
      "recently i've found i can let it sit out just a short amount of time and then just chuck it in the fridge overnight with the same results",
      "technically it's ready to bake at that point , but i find it's very difficult to handle until it sits in the fridge for a good chunk of time first",
      "the coolness makes it a little stiffer",
      "so once it's risen , chuck it in the fridge for another half a day",
      "when you're ready , sprinkle the top of the dough with a few tablespoons of flour , just to make the part where you're going to stick your fingers less sticky , but don't work it in at all",
      "grab the dough by the floury part , lift it partially out and cut off a piece with a bread knife",
      "tuck the edges underneath to form a ball and put it on a pan sprayed with oil and dusted with cornmeal",
      "you want to use a pan deeper than the bread is tall",
      "a dutch oven is ideal , but i use a large loaf pan",
      "i make about 1 / 5 of the dough at a time , which is about the size of an orange , but you can use less or more if you adjust baking times",
      "put the remaining dough back in the fridge , and use it all up in a 10-14 days",
      "when you make the next batch , you can even skip cleaning the container out if you want",
      "the little smudges of leftover flour and dough should incorporate into the new batch with no ill effects",
      "recently i've discovered that if you take an extra minute to shape the remaining dough into a ball before putting it back in the fridge , it pays huge dividends",
      "just pick up the whole thing and spend a minute tucking the edges under , going around and around , and then plop it back in the container",
      "next time you go to cut a hunk of dough off , you'll find the dough is extra bubbly , and it bakes up extra fluffy with nice big air-pocket holes in it",
      "let the newly shaped loaf sit for 30-60 minutes , then cover tightly to keep in the moisture as the bread bakes",
      "this eliminates the need for a pan of water in the bottom of the oven",
      "i used to preheat , but recently i've been putting it in a cold oven with good results",
      "the large toaster oven i use heats up pretty fast , so that may be why it works so well for me",
      "at any rate , you want to bake at 450 for a good long time , then take the lid / foil off to brown for a little more",
      "in my oven , for the size i make that takes about 30-35 minutes , plus 5-10 for the browning",
      "you will have to experiment with your own equipment",
      "let it sit until it cools , then slice and enjoy ! once it's cut , it goes stale pretty quickly , so don't resist that good bread smell too long --",
      "whole wheat , rye , oatmeal , flax , wheat bran , cinnamon , etc",
      "if you don't want to improvise , just find another recipe you like and use that with this method",
      "see the book \"artisan bread in 5 minutes a day\" for other variations and options like pizza , bagels , pretzles , etc",
      "mix the dough , refrigerate for half a day , take the dough and spend a minute shaping into a ball , then put it back in the fridge for another half a day before taking it out and putting it in its final shape"

      "stir to combine",
      "add 2 tbsp of water to the beef mixture , cover , and very gently simmer for 15 minutes",
      "after 15 minutes , taste the meat mixture",
      "the potatoes may not yet be fully cooked but you may need to adjust the seasoning",
      "at this point , i normally add another tbsp of oregano and little bit more salt and pepper",
      "the meat mixture needs to be a little on the salty side and have a robust taste of oregano or the flavors will be very muted after frying the tacos",
      "if the meat is sticking to the skillet or the mixture seems a little dry , add another tablespoon of water",
      "cover and continue to gently simmer for 5 minutes longer",
      "uncover , stir , remove from the heat , and allow to cool for a few minutes",
      "i , personally , like these tacos in taco-size flour tortillas",

      "before filling the tacos , you need to warm the tortillas enough to make them pliable",

      "microwave the tortillas for 25 seconds",

      "place the filled tacos in a single layer on a sheet pan as you prepare them",

      "at this point , the tacos can be frozen and fried at a later date",
      "simple put a single-layer of tacos on a sheet pan and freeze for about 1 hour",
      "i cover each taco in plastic wrap then place the tacos in a freezer bag",
      "before frying , defrost them in microwave or allow them to defrost in the refrigerator overnight",
      "heat several cups of oil in a dutch oven or electric fryer",
      "the oil will need to be about 2 to 3 inches deep",
      "heat the oil to 350f depending on the size of your fryer , you should be able to get 2 to 3 tacos in the fryer at one time",

      "when they have browned on one side , flip them over and brown the other",

    "steps": [
      "ask the butcher to split a few marrowbones lengthwise and extract the marrow for you",
      "have the beef , pork and veal ground together in front of you , for unless you see it you cannot be sure that it will be free of fat",
      "so that they can be chilled , prepare the meat balls at least an hour before you plan to cook them",
      "they are less likely then to crumble and lose their shape when they are fried",
      "soak the crumbs in the four tab",
      "of cream for 5 minutes , then put them in a large mixing bowl with the marrow and ground meats",
      "melt the 2 t",
      "butter in a small frying pan and in it cook the chopped onion , shallots and garlic over moderate heat for 5 min",
      ", or until softened and color lightly",
      "add them to the mixing bowl and at the same time add the grated lemon rind , parsley , salt , pepper , and thyme",
      "beat the 2 eggs lightly with a fork and pour them over the meat",
      "with a large spoon , beat this mixture vigorously until the ingredients are thoroughly combined and the meat loses its granular texture",
      "if you own an electric mixer with a dough hook attachment , the beating operation will be much easier",
      "but do not attempt to use an ordinary beater attachment",
      "it will not work",
      "form into small balls , about an inch in diameter",
      "the simplest and most efficient way to do this is to place a heaping teaspoon of the meat in the palm of of one hand and after moistening the other hand with cold water , roll it lightly over the meat until you have shaped it into a sphere",
      "do not fuss with this too much",
      "when the balls are chilled , you can reshape them easily if you wish",
      "place the meat balls , as you finish them , on a baking sheet or platter lined with wax paper",
      "cover them with another sheet of waxed paper , and chill for at least an hour",
      "for more firmly crusted meatballs , roll each lightly in flour just before frying them",
      "when you are ready to cook the meatballs , melt the 3 tab",
      "butter and 2 tab",
      "oil over high heat in a large heavy frying pan",
      "when the fat begins to sputter , lightly drop into the pan enough meat balls to cover the bottom about three quarters full",
      "at once slide the pan back and forth over the burner so that they roll around in the hot fat",
      "this will help them to keep their shapes and to brown evenly",
      "after a couple of minutes , turn the heat down to moderate , and cook the balls 6-7 minutes longer , or until they are crisp brown all over and cooked through",
      "make sure by breaking one open",
      "there should not be the slightest indication of pink in the center",
      "with a slotted spoon , transfer the finished meatballs to a shallow casserole and continue with the remaining meatballs until they are all cooked",
      "make the sauce in the same frying pan",
      "if the fat remaining in it is a good deep brown",
      "pour off all but 3 tab",
      "of it",
      "if , however , it is black and badly burned , scrape it all out and in its place melt 3 t",
      "butter",
      "off the heat , with a wooden spoon , stir into the pan 2 tab of flour and mix it to a smooth paste with the fat",

      "then pour in , all at once , the cup of stock",
      "raise the heat to moderate and , with a wire whisk , beat this sauce together until it boils , thickens and becomes quite smooth",

    "description": "these tamales are very different from the regular mexican tamales. the masa is different as is the filling and the wrapping. nacatamales are usually only made for special occasions or christmas as they are very time consuming and labor intensive but the end product is well worth it. learning how to make these is a huge milestone in my culture. they can be made vegeterian if you subsitute the chicken broth for veggie broth, the lard for veggie shortening, omit the meat and add sliced zucchini/spinach/sauted poblano peppers with onions or anything else you wish. the masa is the most difficult part. it requires alot of water/broth and constant mixing so that is does not burn (almost like making a roux). it might take a couple of tries before you can get the consitency of the masa right. too much lard, the masa is too greasy. too much water it becomes very sticky (like cookie dough). too little water, the masa will be very dry. once you can make the masa right, you can make these with your eyes closed",

      "that's true , but use it only if you're in pinch ! fresh basil is part of what makes this recipe so absolutely delicious",

      "after thinking about it , i would definitely suggest letting it marinate over night - the longer the better",
      "i also took someone's suggestion to put the cheese on the bread and bake it first - then everyone can put on their own amount of bruschetta",
      "everyone agreed that was the better way to go",
      "this really is easy to make - i also definitely suggest using fresh basil and buying the bread the day you are serving it as well",
      "i will be adding this part to my receipe box , to add to my regular rotation",
      "have made it many times now",
      "and yes there is a reason this recipe lists roma / plum tomatoes as the tomato of choice",
      "they are meatier than a beefsteak , early girl , or some of the other varietals available",
      "using romas will eliminate some of the wateriness that i have mentioned",
      "if you have the opportunity to make this a day ahead , it gives the flavors a chance to marry and allows the garlic to mellow somewhat ~ so much better ! absolutely great as it is , but decided to try adding a smidgen of anchovy paste to it on the third time",
      "it sent it over the edge from outstanding to sublime !",
      "update: 9 / 17 / 13 - 5 or 6 tomatoes roma tomato chopped , 2 cups a #1 tall can =16 oz",
      "and a #300 can =14 to 16 oz",
      "canned would work but be sure to drain it well or your bread will get very soggy",
      "many recipes specify a can size rather than a volume amount",
      "i've tried a bunch of them ! here are a few",
      "perhaps it was my imagination , but i think i lost some of that distinctive sun-dried tomato flavor",
      "2) the recipe suggests that you could use dried basil if you're in a pinch",
      "that's true , but use it only if you're in pinch ! fresh basil is part of what makes this recipe so absolutely delicious",
      "3) the recipe calls for shredded cheese , but i like to buy bulk mozzarella and slice it into pieces that are about 1 / 8\" thick , and that are sized to fit onto the bruschetta",
      "that keeps your cheese from falling off the sides , and it creates a nice \"blanketing\" effect over your tomato mixture that keeps it from falling off when you're eating it",
      "i hope this help",
      "happy cooking !"

      "the easier it wiggles , the better",

      "continue to smoke until internal temperature of 200 is obtained",
      "there will come a point where the temp won't go up no matter what you do",
      "this is normal",
      "resist the temptation to kick up the temp in your smoker",
      "time remaining to achieve 200 should be 5-9 hours",

      "when 200 is obtained , remove from smoker , and allow to cool until it is safe to handle , then carefully lift brisket out and remove to a cutting board , and tent w / foil",

      "reserve pan juice to serve over brisket",
      "once cooled enough , separate the point from the flat",
      "there will be a fairly easy to follow fat layer separating the two",
      "just gently slide a knife through the fat and lift and pull the point away as you cut",
      "if you accidentally cut into the meat , it's no tragedy , just back up a little , and go at it again",

      "you will likely find several slices that are too fatty to serve , or maybe some of the outer shell that's too dry to serve",
      "reserve this meat , chop it fine , freeze , and save for baked bean seasoning",
      "if you look at the flat , you will see that the grain of the meat changes direction about in the middle of the cut",

      "then pour in salt , any salt , until the water line reaches 3 / 4 cup",
      "the water will swallow up almost exactly 1 / 4 pound regardless of whether you use table salt , kosher salt , pickling salt , or sea salt",
      "the volume of these salts may differ , but their water displacement will be the same ! pour the slurry into a very clean non-reactive container large enough to hold the meat and 1 / 2 gallon of water",
      "then add the sugar , garlic , and black pepper",
      "stir until most of the sugar is dissolved",
      "the garlic and pepper will not dissolve much at first",
      "then add the cold water",
      "4) chose your brining container carefully",
      "it needs to be food grade , large enough to hold the meat and the brine with the meat submerged , and it cannot be made of aluminum , copper , or cast iron , all of which can react with the salt",
      "do not use garbage bags or a garbage can or a bucket from home depot",
      "they are not food grade",
      "do not use a styrofoam cooler",

      "if you brine in a zipper bag , periodically grab the bag and squish things around and flip the meat so the brine can get in from all sides",

      "cover with plastic wrap not aluminum foil",
      "gently stir the container occasionally to make sure all parts of the fish come into contact with the brine",
      "5) the length of brining will vary depending on how thick the filets are",
      "brine 2\" thick filets for about 2 hours in the fridge , 1\" filets for 1 hour",
      "drain the fish and discard the brine",
      "then rinse the fish to remove surface salt , and soak them in clear water for about an hour",
      "this helps get rid of excess salt",
      "pat dry with paper towels",
      "some folks like to put the filets in the fridge for an up to 3 hours under the theory that a desirable shiny tacky film or pellicle will form on the surface",
      "it is said to help retain moisture and smoke",
      "i have tried it with and without pellicle and see no quality difference",
      "but a few hours of resting will help the brine to distribute itself evenly through the flesh",

      "don't use foil or parchment paper",
      "we want the fish to stick to the paper to help us remove the skin , and it will not stick to foil or parchment",

      "place the fish on a rack on your grill or smoker so they are not touching each other",

      "7) put the fish into a preheated smoker at about 225f and place the fillet with the probe in the coolest part of the smoker",

      "place the chicken in a large pot at least 7qt",
      "i use my gumbo pot",
      "this recipe makes exactly 5 quarts and you want a little room",
      "cover the chicken with 4 quarts of water",
      "add bay leaves , salt , pepper , poultry seasoning , one of the onions quartered , and 3 celery stalks cut into large pieces",
      "these will cook to the point of mush and be discarded later",
      "put the lid on and boil on medium heat for exactly one hour",
      "occasionally check to make sure it is at a medium boil and move the chicken around in the pot",
      "when the hour has passed turn off the heat , take off the lid and let it cool down for about 15 minutes",
      "then remove the chicken to a large bowl",
      "drain off any broth back into the pot",
      "cut the chicken down the center and open it up so it may cool",
      "set aside",
      "next i strain the broth",
      "i like to have a nice clean broth free of bay leaves , bones , skin etc",
      "if you notice any chicken skin stuck to the pot please remove it",
      "throw it all out including the mushy onion and celery",
      "pour your nice broth back into the pot",
      "chop your remaining onion and celery into nice , pretty small pieces",
      "add it to your broth , put the lid back on and boil on medium heat while you are making your dumplings",
      "now is a good time to clean up your mess",
      "once clean , you will need a nice floured surface about as long and wide as your rolling pin",
      "if you don't have a rolling pin you can use a glass",
      "the area should be about 15x15",
      "in a large mixing bowl add your 5-cups of flour",
      "make a well in the middle and pour in the 2 cups of milk",
      "mix well with a fork until all of the flour is moistened and you can make it all stick together in a dough ball",
      "it is better to have a little dry flour in the bowl than to have dough that is too wet",
      "if you really think you need to add milk do it by spoonfuls",
      "plop the dough out onto your floured surface , roll it around so that the bottom of the dough gets floured and then flip it over and roll the top around in the flour",
      "use your rolling pin or glass to roll the dough out",
      "if it sticks just sprinkle a little flour on the sticky spots",
      "roll it out to a 1 / 4 inch thickness which should cover about a 15x15 area",
      "push in any raggedy ends",
      "use a knife to cut the dough into about 1 1 / 2 inch strips to have nice big dumplings like mine or smaller if you like",
      "at this point take the lid off of the pot",
      "the broth should be at a medium simmer--you need to see bubbles before adding your dumplings",
      "now cut each strip of dough into 1 inch squares",
      "throw each dumpling in the pot as you cut it",
      "after each row stir the pot",
      "continue until you have cut all of the dumplings",
      "stir well making sure all of the dumplings are separate",
      "put the lid on and lower the heat",
      "you want a low simmer",
      "now it is time to remove the chicken from the bone",
      "separate the breast meat into medium sized chunks",
      "everything else usually comes off in bite sized pieces",
      "please make sure you are free of bones , fat and skin",
      "by the time you have all of the chicken removed it is time to add it to the pot",
      "remove the lid and add the chicken",
      "then add the cream of chicken soup , butter and parsley",
      "stir well",
      "you may think your broth looks a little thin",
      "don't worry , it thickens upon standing",
      "first you need to cook your chicken and dumplings a few more minutes now that everything is in the pot",
      "i like to taste test about now and i usually add a little more salt , pepper , and poultry seasoning to suit my taste",
      "let this sit on the stove uncovered over very low heat for about 15 minutes",
      "then turn off the heat completely and let it sit for another 15 minutes",

      "clean the sides of the bowl frequently as you work",
      "if it looks as though the dough is not coming together after 2-3 minutes , add up to 1 tablespoon more flour",
      "when you're finished , the dough should feel somewhat cool",
      "it will be soft and sill sticky and may cling slightly to the sides and bottom of the bowl",
      "first rise: transfer the dough to a very large buttered bowl , cover tightly with plastic wrap , and let it rise at room temperature until doubled in bulk , 2- 2 1 / 2 hours",

      "cover the bowl tightly with plastic wrap and refrigerate the dough overnight , or for at least 4-6 hours , during which time it will continue to rise and may double in size again",
      "after this long chill , the dough is ready to use in any brioche recipe",
      "storing: if you are not going to use or bake the dough after it's second rise , deflate it , wrap it airtight , and store it in the freezer",

(i'm subbing vegetarian bacon for the real bacon. too me the flavor is the same and you don't have all the bad stuff in real bacon.)",

      "if you bake the pumpkin in a casserole , it will keep its shape , but it might stick to the casserole , so you'll have to serve it from the pot which is an appealingly homey way to serve it",
      "if you bake it on a baking sheet , you can present it freestanding , but maneuvering a heavy stuffed pumpkin with a softened shell isn't so easy",
      "however , since i love the way the unencumbered pumpkin looks in the center of the table , i've always taken my chances with the baked-on-a-sheet method , and so far , i've been lucky",

      "clear away the seeds and strings from the cap and from inside the pumpkin",
      "season the inside of the pumpkin generously with salt and pepper , and put it on the baking sheet or in the pot",
      "toss the bread , cheese , garlic , bacon , and herbs together in a bowl",
      "season with pepper you probably have enough salt from the bacon and cheese , but taste to be sure and pack the mix into the pumpkin",

      "stir the cream with the nutmeg and some salt and pepper and pour it into the pumpkin",
      "again , you might have too much or too little you don't want the ingredients to swim in cream , but you do want them nicely moistened",
      "put the cap in place and bake the pumpkin for about 2 hours check after 90 minutes or until everything inside the pumpkin is bubbling and the flesh of the pumpkin is tender enough to be pierced easily with the",
      "because the pumpkin will have exuded liquid , i like to remove the cap during the last 20 minutes or so , so that the liquid can bake away and the top of the stuffing can brown a little",
      "when the pumpkin is ready , carefully , very carefully it's heavy , hot , and wobbly bring it to the table or transfer it to a platter that you'll bring to the table",
      "serving:",
      "you have choices:you can cut wedges of the pumpkin and filling",
      "you can spoon out portions of the filling , making sure to get a generous amount of pumpkin into the spoonful",
      "or you can dig into the pumpkin with a big spoon , pull the pumpkin meat into the filling , and then mix everything up",
      "i'm a fan of the pull-and-mix option",

    "description": "this authentic recipe is from a small fishing village in brittany france, and makes up a huge amount (about 100 galettes) which are like crepes but for savoury fillings. the recipe is from a local restaurant so use the change feature to scale the amounts down to your needs. do try and use real buckwheat flower. hard to find but worth it. the trick is to prepare before hand, so get your mixture ready, then grate your cheese and prep your ham, spinach etc. note that the ingredients only caters for the galettes and not the fillings which you make to order. for the usual filling described below, plan on also having an egg, two thin slices of ham, and a handful of spinach leaves per galette.",
    "minutes": 25,
    "ingredients": [
      "buckwheat flour",
      "rock salt",
      "eggs",
      "milk",
      "water",
      "butter"
    ],
    "steps": [
      "put the dry buckwheat flour and salt into the bowl , then with a spoon push the mix to the edges of the bowl leaving a hole in the center",
      "then pour some of the milk and add some of the eggs into the center of the bowl",
      "with a spoon slowly fold in a little of the flour into the liquid and mix , always keeping the liquid soupy in texture",
      "continue to slowly add the milk and eggs to the center of the bowl and fold in the flour in this way so the mix is never sticky but rather always soupy",
      "doing this results in a non-lumpy mix that is very smooth",
      "mix for a few minutes with an electric mixer , while slowly adding the water to the bowl while mixing",
      "add the water as the flour thickens so that the mixture doesn't become sticky",
      "the final mixture should be more watery than you would expect for north american pancakes , roughly the the consistency of melted chocolate",
      "leave for a few hours in the fridge",
      "after the mix is chilled , check the consistency , if it is too hard then add enough extra water to make mix smooth",
      "again , it should be smooth , silky and as runny as melted chocolate",
      "the mix is now ready to use",
      "to make each galette , heat up two elements on your cooker",
      "one at maximum temperature , the other on a medium heat",
      "place a very flat griddle or large frying pan on the maximum temperature hottest element of the cooker to heat up",
      "add 5 grams of butter to the heated frying pan and wait till it melts and turns brown",
      "then wipe the whole frying surface with paper towel to remove the butter leaving the pan lightly greased",
      "don't be afraid to reuse your paper towel and skip fresh butter between galettes",
      "lift your frying pan slightly off the grill , and add one ladle of mix to the hot pan , so it covers a large surface very thinly",
      "quickly tilt the pan so the mix runs over the whole surface evenly to the edges",
      "try not to add a second ladle to the pan - this doesn't work well , better to live with some holes in the galette",
      "cook the galette for 10-15 seconds on the highest heat , then start to lift the edges of the whole galette up from the pan with a non-stick flat mixing spoon",
      "when you can get a good edge up with the spoon , move the pan to the lower heat element of the cooker",
      "lift up a good edge of the galette from the pan with the spoon , and with your fingers lift up the whole galette off the non-stick pan and then flip it over",
      "the underside should be golden brown with a very few brown spots",
      "keep the pan on the lower medium heat",
      "now add the fillings to the top of the galette's cooked side",
      "filling",
      "a usual filling is made like this: sprinkle on a little grated gruyre cheese , then break an egg yolk over the cheese in the center of the galette",
      "to this , add 2 slices of diced ham onto the runny egg yolk , and then top it off with a handful of torn spinach leaves",
      "the trick is not to overfill the galette",
      "alternatively try different types of cheese , like brie or cheddar , or skip the egg , or skip the ham / spinach",
      "try out loads of combinations - it's like pizzas , you can design your own",
      "let the toppings cook for up to about 1 minute",
      "this is the reason to only use egg yolks , if runny they are nice , egg whites however are not nice undercooked",
      "now , fold the cooked edges of the galette into the center to make a square , to hold the filling",
      "use a spatula to press down on the folded mix so it holds its shape",
      "carefully flip over the parcel , again press down on it with a spatula",
      "the galette should have nice golden colour and some little brown spots on it",
      "serve immediately"

(can substitute jarred roasted red peppers. and green onions are the same as a scallion...) edited to add: sauted portabello strips can completely replace all the fussiness with the dried mushrooms. i also served this with creamed spinach in place of the red pepper sauce. just depends on what color looks best to you.",

    "description": "per the internet site where the recipe was posted, this recipe is from chef andrea apuzzo of andrea's restaurant in new orleans. my sweet hubby gave me a kitchenaid mixer for christmas, and i recently bought the pasta roller & cutter attachments for it. i have tried many, many homemade pasta recipes and finally found one that was perfect! i made it last night for the first time and it made 1.5 pounds of pasta (commercially packaged pasta is normally 1 pound). i cut it really thin for spaghetti, and i'm going to use it for everything now. can't wait to try making homemade ravioli, using this recipe. prep time includes \"rest\" period for dough & 10 minutes of drying time. cooking time includes 10 minutes to bring water to a boil.",

      "remove dough from bowl and hand-knead for 2 to 3 minutes",
      "it should not stick to your fingers or fall apart",
      "to test for the correct consistency , pinch a small amount of dough together after kneading for 2 to 3 minutes -- if the dough stays together without sticking to your fingers or falling apart , it should work well",
      "if too soft , add more flour by dusting the top of the dough and knead some more , continuing to dust the dough with flour until achieving the right consistency",
      "if too dry , wet your hands and knead some more , continuing to wet your hands a little at a time & knead until the right consistency",

    "title": "real down home southern country biscuits and gravy",
    "description": "real, \"down home\" biscuits and gravy was originally \"poor folks' breakfast,\" but it was so good and became so popular that no self-respecting southern home today is complete without a good biscuit and gravy recipe. the gravy is still referred to by many as \"sawmill gravy,\" because gravy and biscuits was a quick, cheap, and filling breakfast that was served in the logging and sawmill camps throughout the south. real \"down home\" southern biscuits and gravy became so popular and such a staple in southern breakfast diets because it is nutritious, simple, easy, and inexpensive to make. the ingredients are simple and can be found in any kitchen. sausage gravy, egg gravy, and all the variations begin with the basic \"sawmill\" or \"milk\" gravy recipe. the recipe given here is the basic sawmill gravy recipe that is still used by most southerners. it is the recipe that my family has used for several generations. as for the biscuits, there are lots of complicated recipes for biscuits \"out there\", but the real, honest-to-goodness biscuits that are served up in most southern homes are simple and easy to make. the baking time is the most time consuming part of making good biscuits. the biscuit recipe i give here has also been used by my family for several generations. when made as directed, the results will be light, fluffy, melt-in-your-mouth biscuits that are delicious with the basic gravy recipe that i also give here, as well as with one's favorite jam, jelly, marmalade, molasses, or honey--or just split open with a little butter melted inside. to make sausage gravy or other variations, cook up the sausage first and use the fat from it to make the rue for the gravy. break up the sausage into small pieces and set within easy reach before starting the gravy when the gravy has thickened, stir in the sausage or other ingredients that you may have in mind. adding other ingredients is the last step in making variations of the basic \"sawmill\" or milk gravy recipe. in the biscuit recipe, martha white self-rising flour is preferred. it is finer ground flour than almost any other flour on the market, has superb leavening, and yields lighter biscuits. if plain flour is used, add 1-1/4 tsp of double-acting baking powder and 1/4 tsp of salt per cup of flour. these pertain to all-purpose flour only and should be omitted when using self-rising flour. also, the rule of thumb for eggs is to use 1 egg for every 2 cups of flour. when making biscuits and gravy, one thing should be remembered: make the biscuits first, and make the gravy while the biscuits are baking. preheat oven to 350 degrees f. baking time for biscuits is 20-30 minutes, depending on your oven. some ovens run a little hot or cool, so baking time may vary slightly.",

      "it's convenient from a cutting point of view if you've got a very small loaf tin , but a flat or round baking tray will do fine",
      "it was originally made as round loaf sitting on a griddle baked in a bastible over the glowing embers of a peat turf fire",
      "because of the way the bread rises it's not essential to be so accurate as it is with a yeast-based bread so volume measures could just as easily be used instead if you don't have a set of kitchen scales as would have been the case across ireland in the early 1800s when they were first made"

      "i rolled the mixture into 1 balls and deep fried them",

      "cut the eggplants into medium slices and soak them in salted water for 1 hour before your commence your sauce so everything will be more conveniently timed",

    "description": "here is an idea for a christmas centerpiece that can be as humbly simple or as lavishly extravagant as you wish. as an artist that works with food, i choose ingredients that look like the things we find in the natural world, but smaller. so a broccoli spear is a tree, cauliflowers become clouds and, as seen in this recipe, rosemary sprigs turn to pine trees. for this particular make-at-home version of a snowy winter wonderland, i have created a christmas tree with sprigs of rosemary as foliage, and an assortment of edible treats for the baubles and gifts under the tree. -- carl warner",

      "carrot",
      "powdered sugar"
    ],
    "steps": [
      "make the base:",
      "to begin , fashion a central trunk from your green floral foam",
      "if you want to use a food-based option , try a conical root like carrot , horseradish , or burdock - that way every part of your centerpiece is edible",
      "once you've selected your base material , bore holes with a bradawl or screwdriver",
      "this method will be how the trunk holds the rosemary sprigs",
      "after boring the holes , push the woody ends of the rosemary sprigs far enough into the trunk so that they wont fall out",
      "start with larger sprigs at the base and work your way up the trunk adding smaller and smaller sprigs as you go",
      "you can always cut sprigs in half to create the smaller sprigs near the top of the tree",
      "the height of your finished tree will depend on the length of your trunk , while the width of your trunk depends on the length of your longest rosemary sprigs at the base of your tree",
      "so if you have six-inch sprigs , the width of your base will be double that",
      "once you have worked your way to the top and evenly spaced your branches all around the trunk , your tree will be complete",
      "at this point , take a good look at the shape of it",
      "if it is too wide in places or uneven in any way , dont worry , you can always snip a bit here and there with a sturdy pair of scissors or garden shears",
      "once you are happy with the shape , you can begin the decorating",
      "this is a great time to get family , friends or children involved , although they could , of course , be making their own especially if you want more than one tree to decorate the table",
      "using toothpicks , push the ends through the rosemary into the trunk leaving their points exposed",
      "if your base is small , you may need to cut your toothpicks in half",
      "space them evenly up and down and around the tree",
      "then push your decorations onto the exposed points",
      "these ornaments can be whatever you want , from marzipan fruits as listed in the instructions to frosted jellies , candied fruits , chocolates , or any sort soft candy",
      "now that you've decorated the tree , you need to finish it off with a star on the top",
      "this can be cut from a candied lemon or orange slice , or as i have used , and listed in the directions , a slice of star fruit",
      "having completed your tree , place it on to a round cake plate or chopping board",
      "if your rosemary sprigs go all the way down to the base of the tree , it should stand easily",
      "however , if you have kept the bottom of the trunk clear of sprigs you may need to secure your tree on to a spike by drilling a hole into your base and putting a nail or screw through it",
      "you could also use a glue-style icing one uses when assembling gingerbread houses",
      "after ensuring your tree is stabilized , you can add more sweets , candies and treats around the base",
      "these candies act as the presents under the tree , while also saving your beautiful tree from hungry hands",
      "the beauty of this idea is that it can be tailored to your time and budget , and if you dont have a sweet tooth you can always decorate your tree with spices such as cinnamon and star anise to combine with the rosemary and fill the room with christmas aromas",
      "whichever way you choose , the scent of rosemary will fill the home and fill your guests with wonderment and intrigue",
      "of course , if you want to take your tree to another level , you can always do what i have done here and build a whole landscape of rosemary sprigs pushed into fondant icing that has been rolled over loaves of stale bread",
      "nuts and chocolate swirls provided the rocks and fence posts , and a blue bulb in an overhead light bathes the scene in moonlight",
      "finally , a dusting of icing sugar over the whole set gives that freshly fallen snow look , creating a feast for the eyes and the imagination at this magical time of year",

    "steps": [
      "combine all ingredients in a non-reactive pot , bring mixture to a boil , lower heat and simmer for 15-20 minutes",
      "allow brine to cool completely",
      "rinse turkey under cool running water , inside and out",
      "pat turkey dry with paper towels , then immerse turkey in cooled brine",
      "turkey should be completely submerged in liquid",
      "cover the pot and refrigerate for 8-10 hours or up to 24 hours",
      "remove turkey , rinse , pat dry , and roast as usual",
      "cook's",
      "this will dry the skin and result in its being crispy at serving time",
      "this resting period has the added advantage of evening the degree of brininess throughout the meat , and resting produces a slightly more tender result",
      "be sure the container used for brining turkey is non-reactive: use enamel , glass or crockery or stainless steel - never cast iron or aluminum",
      "the pot should be just large enough to contain the turkey",
      "brining bags are now available from many cookware stores , as well as giant-size ziplock bags that may be used alone , or use within a sturdy pot",
      "we have learned that many folks do not have sufficient room in their refrigerators or sometimes a pot big enough for the turkey in its brine",
      "our solution is suggest that the turkey be placed , along with the brine , in a food-safe plastic bag , such as a turkey roasting bag",
      "then , the bag , with turkey and brine inside , can be placed in an insulated cooler , a large stock pot or plastic crate , and surrounded by ice , blue ice or empty plastic bottles that have been filled with water and frozen",
      "[the latter suggestions are to keep ice from melting into water which can be messy",
      "] then the cooler is closed , or the sink covered , and the turkey can be brined there for the number of hours required checking to be sure that the temperature of the brine is maintained at below 40 degrees , for safety",
      "it is imperative that the temperature never be allowed to rise above 40 degrees add more ice / blue / ice as needed",
      "for the desired chemical effect to take place , however , the proportions cannot be less than 2 / 3 to 1 cup of salt per gallon of water or other liquid",
      "types of salt:",
      "kosher salt is the only type of salt to be used in making brine",
      "kosher salt is available in two varieties",
      "the most common is flaked salt which has been pressed into flakes by rollers",
      "the other type is a four-sided crystal",
      "the crystal-shaped salt measures differently because of its shape",
      "use about 25% more crystal salt than flaked salt when measuring for brine or other recipes",
      "the formula is: 1 tablespoon of regular table salt is equivalent to 1 tablespoons flaked kosher salt , or 2 tablespoons , diamond crystal kosher salt",
      "when a turkey will be deep fried , too much sugar will cause the bird to blacken on the outside",
      "it is best , therefore to use water , rather than apple juice or cider , and to greatly reduce the amount of sugar called for in the above listing of brine ingredients",
      "variations:",
      "a listener called last year to report that using beer instead of juice resulted in a wonderful flavor - she even used guiness , a more bitter-tasting beer - and loved it !",
      "along the same vein , another listener said that she made the brine as directed , then - after it had cooled - she added an equivalent amount of flat dark beer and another full one cup of brown sugar",
      "after stirring the mixture until the sugar dissolved , she proceded to brine her turkey in the mixture - and indicated that the result was just fabulous",
      "brining a goose: this brine works exceptionally well for brining a goose before roasting",
      "the meat of the goose benefits greatly from brining for 12 to 24 hours",
      "follow the same directions for goose as you would for brining a turkey"

    "description": "this recipe is adapted from liana krissoff's book, \"canning for a new generation\". it is a delicious jam which does not use too much sugar, and because of this the flavor of the fruit really shines through. if they are available, i like to use meyer lemons for the juice and the zest, because they have such a nice fragrance. but if you can only find regular lemons they will work just as well. you will need a jelly bag or some cheesecloth to hold the apple cores and trimmings while they simmer in the jam. these will provide the pectin needed to help the jam set. you use the cold plate test to check the set of this jam. i have included instructions on how to do this below.",
    "minutes": 60,
    "ingredients": [
      "granny smith apples",
      "blueberries",
      "sugar",
      "fresh lemon juice",
      "lemon, zest of"
    ],
    "steps": [
      "peel , core , and dice the apples , reserving the trimmings",
      "put as many of the apple trimmings in a jelly bag or 4 layers of cheesecloth as will fit , and tie the bag closed",
      "set the diced apples aside",
      "don't worry about it if they start to brown a bit",
      "they are going to be turned purple by the blueberries anyway",
      "place two or three small saucers in the freezer",
      "you will use these later to check the set of the jam",
      "put the blueberries and sugar in a wide , 6 to 8 quart preserving pan",
      "i use a potato masher to mash up some of the blueberries , about a third of them , but you don't have to do this",
      "i just feel that it gets the juices flowing quicker",
      "if you do not have a preserving pan , use the widest pan you have",
      "the wider the pan , the more quickly moisture will evaporate from the mixture , and this is what you want when you are making jelly , jam , or marmalade",
      "bring the berries and sugar to a simmer over medium heat , stirring frequently , then continue to cook until the juices are just deep enough to cover the blueberries , about 5 minutes",
      "pour the berries into a colander set over a large bowl and stir the berries gently to drain off the juice",
      "return the juice to the pan , along with the diced apples and the bag with the trimmings , and bring to a boil over high heat",
      "boil , stirring occasionally , until the syrup is reduced and thick",
      "this usually takes about 15 to 20 minutes",
      "take the pan off the heat and remove the bag containing the apple trimmings from the syrup and place it between two plates",
      "hold these plates over the preserving pan , and squeeze the plates together to squeeze out any juice which is in the bag",
      "you don't have to try to get every last bit of juice out , just as much as you can get reasonably , and then set the bag aside",
      "return the blueberries and any accumulated juice , along with the lemon juice and zest , to the pan and bring to a simmer",
      "simmer , stirring frequently , for 5 minutes , and then check the set",
      "use the cold plate test to check set: take the pan of jam off the heat place a drop of the jam mixture on one of the saucers you've kept in the freezer , & place the plate back in the freezer for 1 minute",
      "after 1 minute , take the saucer out of the freezer and nudge the drop of jam with your finger",
      "if it \"wrinkles\" when you nudge it with your finger it is done",
      "if the jam is not set , continue cooking over medium-high heat , checking the set again every 5 minutes",
      "once the jam is set , remove it from the heat and stir gently for a few seconds to distribute the fruit in the liquid",
      "ladle the jam into sterilized canning jars , leaving 1 / 4\" headspace",
      "wipe the rims of the jars with damp paper towels to remove any jam which got on the rims or the threads",
      "place the lids and the bands on the jars , just tightening the bands finger",
      "process in a boiling water bath for 5 minutes , then remove and let sit , undisturbed , for at least 12 hours before checking seals",
      "it is important to let them sit undisturbed for 12 hours because the sealing compound on the lids is still cooling and hardening , completing the seal",
      "while the jars cool , you will hear a \"plink\" type sound from each jar - this is the jars completing the vacuum seal as the final air escapes the jar",
      "after 12 hours have passed , remove the bands and check the lids - press down in the center of the lid",
      "if you cannot push the lid down any further , the jar is sealed",
      "if the lid \"gives\" a bit , and you can push it down , the jar did not seal",
      "you can either put the band back on the jar , and reprocess it for another 5 minutes , or you can just put it in the fridge and use it within 3 months"

    "description": "i will not pretend that this pie is easy or quick to make, however, if you want to impress your friends or family with a sensational \"posh\" english raised pie then this is the recipe for you! tender chunks of chicken with pork sausage meat and ham are encased in crisp hot water crust pastry, liberally seasoned with spices and herbs; this pie makes a simply stunning centrepiece for any glyndebourne style picnic event or for a special celebratory cold buffet, such as weddings, christenings or anniversaries. the pastry used in this pie recipe is hot water crust pastry, which is a direct descendant of \"coffer\" paste that was used to encase and protect meat whilst it cooked centuries ago – the pies then being called “coffyns”! the pastry is shaped by hand whilst it is still warm, and is excellent for using with intricate pie moulds - the technique is known as \"hand raised\" and pies made this way are called \"raised pies\". the pastry is easy to make, but must be kept warm whilst you are using it - i keep mine warm over a pan of simmering water. this pastry is excellent for all types of traditional raised pies, such as game pies, pork pies and veal and ham pies. (preparation time includes the one day needed for the pie to cool down and then for jellied stock to be added, and then allowing for the jellied stock to set.)",

      "chop up one leek , white part only",
      "add to the pot along with the chicken stock cubes and all of the dry spices , i really use about a pinch of each spice , but you should add to suit your own taste",
      "on a medium heat , boil the chicken and leek with spices until the chicken is totally cooked through",
      "if you are using a whole chicken this will be around 1 hour , adding more water when necessary",
      "if using cut up pieces it will be about 30 minutes",
      "if using a whole chicken remove it from the broth and place in a separate bowl at this stage",
      "you will now remove all the skin and bones from the chicken and disgard them , and put only the meat of the chicken back into the broth , you may want to let it cool a bit before handling it",
      "if i am using a whole chicken i usually just put the breast and wing meat back into my dumplings , and save all of the dark meat for chicken salad sandwiches",
      "if you are using already cut up chicken for this recipe , you can simply proceed to the next step",
      "add fresh chopped celery and carrots and continue boiling with chicken",

      "add cream of chicken soup and stir well , you may need to add more water , if it has boiled down a great deal",
      "you may add as many or as few vegetables as you like",

      "i have found that using the frozen mixed vegetables and frozen green beans turns out really yummy , and is much easier than cutting up all the celery and carrots",
      "either way it turns out nicely even without any extra vegies",
      "check the consistancy of your broth",
      "it should be thick and soupy , but you want enough liquid in there to cook your dumplings properly , so add more water to suit , i usually don't need to at this stage",

    "description": "homemade mayonnaise is truly great; most people don't bother to make it because you can buy it so easily in the store, but homemade really is much better.i have never had this recipe fail. i have also made it in a food processor, using the little hole in the pusher to dribble the oil in, but it's just a lot easier and quicker to make it using the immersion blender. most mayonnaise recipes fail because they call for too much oil. an egg yolk can only absorb about 2/3 to 3/4 of a cup of oil (larger eggs can sometimes take a bit more than 3/4 of a cup). this recipe calls for 1 and 1/2 cups of oil to 2 egg yolks, which is why it emulsifies so well. also, the 2 teaspoons of water broaden the space between the fat droplets, which helps to create a stronger and more stable emulsion. if you are worried about salmonella you can use pasteurized eggs. see notes below re: lacto-fermented mayonnaise, oil choices, pasteurizing egg yolks, and batch size. \"cooking time\" is blending time.",

      "gently pour the grape seed oil on top of all the other ingredients in the beaker",
      "place the stick blender in the beaker , with the bottom of the blender resting on the bottom of the beaker",
      "pulse the blender , about three seconds at a time , keeping the bottom of the blender in contact with the bottom of the beaker",
      "do this until you see the mixture begin to emulsify",
      "once the bottom fourth of the mixture is emulsified , begin to slowly raise the stick blender , incorporating more of the oil into the emulsification",
      "i use a slow up and down movement , incorporating a bit more oil each time i raise the blender up",
      "continue until all the oil is incorporated",
      "i continue to blend , moving the blender up and down and around the beaker , for about 30 seconds after all the oil has been incorporated , because i like my mayo to be thick",
      "refrigerate and use within one week",
      "if you use all olive oil , the mayonnaise will taste predominantly of olive oil , so take that into account , and think about the recipe you will be using the mayo in before you use all olive oil",
      "you can also experiment with using blends of different oils",
      "if you are using the stick blender technique , you can make a half recipe , but i wouldn't try a half recipe if you are making the mayo using a food processor",
      "to make lacto-fermented mayo:",
      "omit the 2 teaspoons cold water and add 1 tablespoon whey instead",
      "add the whey when you are adding the lemon juice and vinegar",
      "make the mayo as usual , but when you are finished , leave it to sit out at room temperature for 7 hours before putting it in the fridge",
      "mayo made this way will last in the fridge for 6 months",
      "i like to use an oil blend in my lacto-fermented mayonnaise - i use 1 / 3 macadamia nut oil , 1 / 3 almond oil , and 1 / 3 extra virgin olive oil",
      "to make whey: buy a container of plain whole fat yogurt - make sure it is true plain yogurt , no sugars or anything else added",
      "also , you do not want \"greek\" style yogurt - this yogurt has already been strained and has had most of its whey removed already",
      "wet some cheesecloth , wring it out , and place it in a strainer over a bowl",

      "the resulting liquid is whey",
      "place the whey in a sealed container in the fridge - it will keep for up to 6 months",
      "you can eat the concentrated yogurt cheese which is left behind",
      "to pasteurize egg yolks: gather 3 whisks or forks",
      "place the egg yolks in a small bowl and use the first whisk or fork to combine the egg yolks with 1 tablespoon lemon juice",

      "continue for 8 more seconds , then remove and whisk vigourously with the third clean whisk until the mixture is smooth and creamy",
      "the yolks are now safe to use in mayonnaise or other raw-egg preparations",

    "description": "this recipe is for the serious bread maker. use your kitchenaid for a lighter inside (perfect for subs and pasta dishes) or make it 100% hand-made which will produce a bread that is more dense and hearty (for dunking in soups and stews). buddha says to 'be one with the bread' and make it by hand, but the starter makes 2 batches, so we suggest trying it both ways. you will need to begin making this bread the day before it's needed. the result is three very wonderful artisan loaves of italian bread that is soft and airy on the inside, and light and crunchy on the outside. this recipe is an adaption of a recipe from amy scherber. we've made it simpler with quite a few modifications. :)",

      "sponge starter : mix all the sponge starter ingredients together using a kitchenaid with dough hook , on medium speed for 1 to 2 minutes until a somewhat elastic and very stiff batter has formed",
      "scrape the sponge into a plastic container and cover it with a see-thru lid",
      "let the sponge rest about 6 hours at room temperature until it has risen to the point where it just begins to collapse",
      "the sponge will triple in volume and small dents and folds will begin to appear in the top as it reaches its peak and then begins to deflate",
      "the sponge starter is now ready",
      "to make the bread: combine the warm water and yeast in your kitchenaid bowl and stir with a fork to dissolve the yeast",
      "let stand for 3 minutes",
      "add the cool water and 1 / 2 of the sponge starter to the yeast mixture and mix for about 1 minute , breaking up the sponge",
      "the mixture should look milky and slightly foamy",
      "add the flour and salt and mix to incorporate the flour , scraping the sides of the bowl until the dough gathers into a mass",
      "it will be wet and sticky , with long strands of dough hanging from the dough hook",
      "if the dough is not sticky , add 1 tablespoon of water",
      "add a tbsp or so of flour and knead for 2-3 minutes , until it becomes supple and fairly smooth",
      "this is a sticky , wet dough",
      "don't be tempted to add too much flour",
      "turn off the mixer , and using a large dish towel or plastic wrap , cover the bowl while still on the mixer and allow the dough to rest for 15 minutes",
      "remove plastic wrap and knead the dough again for 2-3 minutes , until it is stretchy and smooth yet still slightly sticky",
      "dump the dough onto the counter and shape it into a loose ball , place it in a lightly oiled bowl , and turn the dough in the bowl to coat with oil",
      "cover the bowl tightly with plastic wrap and let the dough rise in a warm dark place for 1 hour then transfer the bowl to the refrigerator for 8 hours to let it relax , develop flavor , and become more manageable",
      "take the dough from the refrigerator and let it sit at room temperature for 2 hours , until it begins to warm up and starts to rise",
      "flour a work surface well and gently dump the dough onto it",
      "divide the dough into three equal pieces",
      "working with one piece at a time , gently flatten , pressing out some of the air bubbles , and stretch it into a rectangle",
      "fold the top third down and the bottom third up as if you were folding a business letter",
      "seal the seam with the heel of your palm , then repeat with the letter fold",
      "now form the loaf into a baguette by rolling the dough into a loaf shape",
      "the loaves should now be about 10 inches long",
      "place loaf onto a sheet of parchment paper with enough room for the other two loaves",
      "make the other two loaves",
      "the loaves will be soft and slightly irregular in shape",
      "leave space between the loaves as they will spread as they rise",
      "cover the loaves with well oiled plastic and let them rise for 2 hours",
      "place a baking stone in the oven on the 2nd rack from the bottom and preheat the oven to 450f",

      "carefully slide them with the parchment paper onto the baking stone in the oven",
      "using a plant sprayer , quickly mist the loaves and the sides of the oven with water , then quickly shut oven door",
      "mist the loaves again after 2 minutes , and again after another 2 minutes",
      "bake for about 25 minutes or until the loaves sound slightly hollow when tapped on the bottom and the crust is a medium to dark brown",

    "description": "spotting the rhubarb patch in the garden whilst 'watering' the dog this morning i decided upon a unusual variant of a breakfast i make several times a week. i was especially hungry this morning but didn't want to bump up the calories as i've been pigging out on fruit scones much more than i should have for the last few days so i wanted to make it as big as possible, but harmlessly. i've also been making soda bread recently so ideas kind of gelled together. this was a really special sweet treat which just happened to fill the role of being a healthy breakfast that filled me up nicely, and kids young and old will adore it. i'm definitely doing it again. i called it a pudding because it really was like eating a delicious dessert pudding, but for breakfast!! - plus this would also be particularly nice set cold and firm and served with ice-cream or nonfat sweetened greek-style yogurt (or cream?!). i imagine it would be miles better made with buttermilk but i didn't want to open any fresh cartons so i used dried milk as i don't keep or use fresh milk. this is very low in fat and calories (about 300 - 350 with quantities as listed using all the low fat and low sugar options) and is incredibly good for you as it contains lots of calcium, riboflavin, vitamin c, minerals and a whole host of other good stuff. the fact that it tastes absolutely wonderful is a superb bonus! i expect it would re-size very easily although you might want to adjust sweetness if you did - but that's a personal taste thing anyway!",

    "title": "chicken pie traditional south african style",
    "description": "chicken pie is one of our favourite dinner or festive dishes. of course, as with all traditional dishes the world over, there are many slight variations, although the spices should be the same as given here. this recipe is about as close to the genuine old-fashioned one as possible, and although seasonings can be varied, subtle nutmeg and clove are non-negotiable! as modern supermarket chickens cannot compare to the flavour of my grannies' and mom's free-range birds, do shop for a plump, golden bird and avoid pale, thin-looking specimens. is sago easily obtainable in the us? it looks like tapioca, only much smaller. sago is also necessary, really, to thicken the sauce. this recipe is juicy but never watery. don't mind my lengthy instructions: i hope it makes the easy recipe easier for you. this is great food to take to a potluck dinner, but it should not be served cold. time to prepare is a guess -- many factors can affect it. for the pastry lid i recommend using recipe #197151, otherwise use flaky/puff pastry. i give the metric amounts in brackets). note: as a traditional recipe, nothing in the way of veggies are added. it is meant to be purely a chicken pie, apart from the ham slices used.",

      "buy a nice chubby chicken , and make up the shortfall with a pack of chicken pieces",
      "we prefer the brown meat , which is more flavourful than breasts)",
      "defrost the pastry in the fridge or at room temperature , but make sure it stays cool",
      "if you made my gran's sour cream pastry , keep in plastic wrap in fridge until needed",
      "use a large pot , like a soup pot",
      "add the water , and then the whole chicken , any extra fat removed",
      "add giblets as well , if available",
      "sprinkle over the stock powder or granules: please",
      "put on lid",
      "bring to boil , turn down heat , keep lid on , and boil chicken gently until almost tender , about 45 minutes",
      "then soak the sago granules in a little warm water -- they swell a little -- and add , stirring it into the water around the chicken",
      "simmer with lid on until chicken flesh almost falls from bones , and the sago has turned into translucent little pearls",
      "take chicken out of the sauce and leave in a dish to cool down",
      "leave the sauce in the pot , but give the bottom a good scrape to loosen the bits that stick",
      "bits of meat can stay in the sauce , just lift out any bones with a slotted spoon: the wing",

      "don't cut up meat too finely -- bite-sized",
      "rub soft meat and skin off carcass and wings so you use it all",
      "then , with a slotted spoon , remove remaining meaty bits from the sauce in the pot , and add all edibles to the chicken meat , discarding small bones",
      "don't worry about the sauce in the pot: it will still have bits in it",
      "add the flour to the sauce , and whisk in smoothly",
      "a wire whisk usually does the job with no lumps remaining",
      "add all the flavourings to the sauce , and taste the result -- chickens differ , flavourings differ",

    "description": "the history of baked alaska thanks to charles ranhofer, chef at the famous delmonico's restaurant in new york, for creating this spectacular cake to celebrate the united states purchase of alaska from the russians. ranhofer is said to have invented it to commemorate seward's purchase of alaska in 1867. it was, at first, called alaska-florida cake, but was soon changed to baked alaska. it is was supposedly later popularized worldwide by jean giroix, chef in 1895 at the hotel de paris in monte carlo. please don't hesitate to refreeze if the ice cream starts to soften. the key to success for this recipe is to keep the ice cream as cold as possible and turn up the oven as high as it will go. worried about salmonella: egg safety i’ve never had any trouble when making this because i took the precautions. always purchase your eggs from a reputable source, a place you can trust with your life. please! don't use eggs after the expiration date on the carton. but salmonella could sneak into some eggs, so just be cautious about serving young kids or the elderly or to people who have health problems. do read through directions before making.",

    "steps": [
      "i used bosina robiola , which is a lightly aged sheeps milk cheese from the south piedmont region of italy , that comes in about 3 / 4x4\"x4\" squares",
      "other varieties , all from northern italy , may be made from cow , sheep or goat milk and may have a thicker round shape like a small brie or a cube shape",
      "all of the aged robiola cheeses tend to have a creamy yellow interior and have a white , yellowish , or pinkish rind",
      "if you cant find robiola , feel free to use an aged brie or camembert cheese , including part of the crust , or stracchino or bel paese or fontina",
      "the flavors are fairly similar",
      "the main thing is that you want a fairly pungent cheese",
      "pound each pieces of meat between pieces of plastic wrap until about 1 / 8 thick , being careful not to tear it any more than necessary",
      "it helps to sprinkle the meat with a little water before placing between plastic sheets",
      "season meat fairly generously on both sides with granulated garlic , seasoned salt , black pepper , and oregano",
      "sprinkle generously with balsamic vinegar , rub in spice , and marinate at room temperature for 1 / 2 hour or in the refrigerator for several hours",
      "when ready to stuff meat rolls , cut chilled cheese into batons about 3 / 4 square and 3\" long , making sure you get some of the rind with each piece , reserving any leftover cheese for the sauce",
      "wrap each piece of cheese with sage leaves , and with optional prosciuto , if desired , to minimize leaks later on",
      "place a wrapped piece of cheese on each piece of meat , and roll the meat around the cheese bundles , folding in the ends as you go",
      "tie each meat roll with kitchen string , or pin them shut with toothpicks , and dredge them lightly in seasoned flour , coating all over , and shaking off excess flour",
      "refrigerate meat rolls until ready to cook",
      "chop remaining sage leaves , and set aside",
      "coarsely chop sage stems",
      "place cream in a medium saucepan over medium heat , and add sage stems , half of the chopped garlic , and a couple tablespoons of the chopped onion",
      "bring to a boil , reduce heat , and simmer for about 20 minutes to infuse flavors",
      "add remaining robiola cheese scraps , including rind , and simmer about 5 minutes longer or until cheese has melted , strain cream mixture , pressing on solids to get out as much liquid and soft solids as possible , and set aside",
      "heat about 1 / 4 cup of olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat , saute meat rolls until well browned on all sides , and set them aside",
      "discard oil , except for about 2 tbsp , and saute remaining onions and garlic until onions are just beginning to brown around the edges",
      "add mushrooms , increase heat to high , and season to taste with salt and pepper",
      "saute until mushroom have given up their moisture , and most of the moisture has evaporated",
      "add seasoned cream , and 1 / 2 cup stravecchio or parmigiano-reggiano cheese , and stir until cheese is melted",
      "if desired , add flour-water mixture and bring to a boil to thicken",
      "remove string or toothpicks from meat rolls and bury them in the mushroom sauce mixture",
      "cover , and simmer until heated through",
      "to serve , slice each meat roll in 4-5 pieces , and serve alongside hot noodles or rice",
      "spoon mushrooms and sauce over meat and noodles",
      "serve with a nice vinaigrette salad and hot crusty french bread with cold butter"

    "description": "prep time includes resting/rising. also a copycat of pappa roti. these are delicious and so different- not really mexican, they are from malaysia. it is like a thin coffee butter cookie spread over the bun. when you bite into these the outside is crisp while the inside is soft and buttery. i have been told you can freeze the cooked buns and heat in an oven for 10-12 min.(never tried this)--the texture does end up being more chewy/dense after the first day (still tastes good)--so i halve the recipe if i know they won't get eaten by the next morning. or refrigerate half the dough to use the next day. the outer crust will go soft after a while--if the buns are room temperature, heat in oven for about 4-5 minutes and then take out and wait a minute or two and it crisps up again. you may need extra bread flour in the final dough when kneading if too sticky...add a tbs at a time. this recipe is converted from metric to us measurements so it is not always easy to get exact.",

      "take an small pot such as an small washed empty yogurt pot or egg cup and put in about a medium teaspoon of chunky orange marmalade",

      "porridge:",
      "measure the porridge oats - i suggest 57g as a good sized portion into a saucepan",
      "i tested this to work out to be pretty much exactly 4 tablespoons extremely well heaped",
      "i'm on a calorie-controlled diet and this is just enough for me to enjoy without feeling either underfed or too heavy - but you may prefer more or less and adjust the other ingredients accordingly",
      "add 345ml water - or enough to be absorbed to your satisfaction",
      "water weighs 1g per ml so you can weigh in 345g if you have electronic scales",
      "add just a couple of small drops vanilla flavouring - i prefer the articifial one as it's got a much stronger flavour - if you use real vanilla essence you may need about 1 / 3 teaspoon because it's so much weaker",
      "add about 1 / 3 teaspoon of ground ginger - quite a lot is really good ! - but breakfast time cravings vary about as much as personal tastes :)",
      "add about 1 / 3 teaspoon caraway seeds",
      "place on stove and boil and simmer until just the consistency you like",
      "when just about thick enough , add 2 medium teaspoons of splenda , or granulated sweetener or sugar and stir it in well",
      "pour into breakfast bowl and top with about 1 1 / 2 to 1 1 / 2 teaspoons natural yogurt or single cream if you're not counting calories",
      "sprinkle the top , in particular the yogurt with a teaspoon or two of splenda",
      "add the prepared , diluted marmalade over the yogurt",
      "serve",
      "don't go too mad with the yogurt or cream ! it actually tastes better if you don't drown it in yogurt or cream - probably because the porridge itself tastes so wonderful",
      "suggestions for alternative toppings:",
      "as an alternative to orange marmalade you might try a couple of teaspoons of orange or lemon juice , or crushed hazelnuts , or ginger jam / conserve , or pieces of crystallized ginger or slices of ginger preserved in sugar syrup , or maybe just honey",
      "you might like to sometimes put a teaspoon of raisins in with the topping for a special treat",
      "incidentally i'm currently using 'streamline' 'zest' reduced sugar , high-fruit orange & grapefruit marmalade which is to die for if you can get it !",
      "sweeteners:",
      "if using a different granulated sweetener it's worth knowing that aspartame becomes unstable and loses its sweetness above 85 degrees centigrade hence the suggestion to use splenda which is fine above 100 centigrade and can be boiled no problem",
      "some granulated sweeteners contain acesulphame-k in addition to aspartame",
      "acesulphame-k stays sweet above 100 centigrade but some people think it doesn't taste so nice :) if in doubt , maybe spoil yourself and use sugar !",

    "title": "easy electric pressure cooker chicken stock",
    "description": "let me just say that i love my 8 quart oval electric pressure cooker, and i use it almost exclusively for making stock. and cheesecake. (that's another recipe for another time...) it is so easy and cost effective, not to mention better tasting and better for you - i can't imagine going back to canned broth! i started by following lorna sass's recipe to the letter - until i realized that you can't really make a \"mistake\" making stock. i got tired of throwing away scraps every day, and tired of buying fresh veggies just for stock. i have included step-by-step photos to show how little waste there really is. basically, over time, i put all of my veggie scraps into a gallon zipper freezer bag - onions (with skins), carrot peels and tops, celery leaves and ends, and garlic peels and ends, and parsley stems. i've tried adding veggies like mushrooms, but this yielded too strong a flavor, so i quickly went back to the basics. when the bag is full, i make stock. usually, the timing is good - by the time the bag is full, i'm almost out of stock anyway. if i've used bone-in chicken in the meantime, i'll save those scraps, too, in a separate bag. when the time comes, if i feel the ratio of veggies is off, i'll add a little more of one or the other - usually, i add some extra celery leaves, as i don't use as much celery as i do carrots and onions, for example. but whatever - like i said, you really can't mess this up. because i'm using an 8-quart cooker, and filling it to the max, i get a lot of stock! plus, by starting with a whole roasting chicken, i can usually harvest about 4 cups of cooked chicken meat to use in other recipes as well. considering i can get a roaster for 75 cents a pound, and everything else is scraps, that's quite a bargain!!",

    "title": "goat s cheese shallot and leek tart a bit of a french tart",
    "description": "a very simple and extremely tasty tart that i often make when leeks are in season. you can make your own pastry if you wish - i do when i have lots of time, but this works equally well with good quality ready-made flaky pastry, thus cutting down on time. try to use small, thin leeks and try to get hold of little pink shallots - it just makes it so colourful when cut and served. this tart freezes beautifully; you just need about 3-4 hours to defrost it and then to reheat it, just pop it into the oven on a low heat for about 10 to 15 minutes. however, it is delicious served and eaten cold as well. great picnic food or wonderful for a light & elegant luncheon dish. i also serve this at celebrations as part of a finger buffet - it can be baked in a square tin for events like that - making it easier to cut and portion. one point, this is what i would call a soft set tart - so when you take it out of the oven, do not be alarmed if it appears to be too soft; it will set as it cools, making it deliciously creamy and not at all rubbery! n.b. i have called this a bit of a french tart, just a play on my zaar name! but, it could be welsh, using welsh goat's cheese & welsh leeks, or even english, you can obtain a wonderful array of english goat's cheeses now.",

      "you will need a 7 inch diameter fluted quiche tin with a removable base , 1 inches deep , very lightly buttered , and a small , solid baking sheet",

      "now prepare the leeks",
      "first , take the tough green ends off & discard them",
      "leave some of the lighter green & then make a vertical split about halfway down the centre of each one and clean them by running them under the cold-water tap while you fan out the layers this will rid them of any hidden dust and grit",
      "then slice them in half lengthways and chop into -inch slices",
      "next , in a medium-sized frying pan , melt the butter over a gentle heat and add the leeks , shallots and some salt",
      "give it all a good stir and let them cook gently , without a lid , for 10-15 minutes or until the juice runs out of them",
      "then you need to transfer them to a sieve set over a bowl to drain off the excess juice",
      "place a saucer with a weight on top of them to press out every drop",
      "roll it out into a circle on a lightly floured surface",
      "as you roll , give it quarter turns to keep the round shape and roll it as thinly as possible",
      "now transfer it , rolling it over the pin , to the tin",
      "press it lightly and firmly over the base and sides of the tin , easing any overlapping pastry back down to the sides , as it is important not to stretch it",
      "now trim the edges and press the pastry up about inch above the rim of the tin all round , and then prick the base all over with a fork",
      "after that , paint some of the beaten egg for the filling over the base and sides",
      "now place the tin on the baking sheet and bake for 20-25 minutes or until the pastry is crisp and golden",
      "check halfway through the cooking time to make sure that the pastry is not rising up in the centre",
      "if it is , just prick it a couple of times and press it back down with your hands",
      "while the pastry case is pre-baking , crumble the goats' cheese with your hands , and then gently combine it with the leeks & shallots in the sieve",
      "now , in a jug , mix the beaten eggs with the crme frache or double cream , seasoning with just a little salt and a good grinding of freshly milled black pepper",
      "as soon as the pastry case is ready , remove it from the oven",
      "arrange the leeks , shallots and cheese all over the base",
      "pour the cream and egg mixture over the top of the cheese , shallots & leeks , then put the tart back on the baking sheet with the oven shelf half pulled out , then gently slide the shelf back in and bake the tart for 30-35 minutes , until it's firm in the centre and the surface has turned a lovely golden brown",
      "next , remove it from the oven and allow it to settle for 10 minutes before serving",
      "these 10 minutes is important , as it will be much easier to cut into portions",
      "the best way to remove the tart from the tin is to ease the edges from the sides of the tin with a small knife , then place it on an upturned jar or tin , which will allow you to carefully ease the sides away",
      "next slide a palette knife or wide fish slice underneath and ease the tart on to a plate or board ready to serve , or simply cut it into portions straight from the tin base",

    "description": "after a great deal of searching for this style of roll for the 2008 4th of july holiday, i fiddled with the recipe and came up with a much better version. i hope that you enjoy these as much as we do. they are great rolls! rich in eggs and butter, this dough is soft and tender and does not require excessive kneading. it is easy to make by hand and even easier if you have an electric mixer with a dough hook. please note that when i make these rolls i use the 'dough setting' on my bread maker to mix the ingredients and get through the first rise. please follow your bread makers instructions for adding ingredients if you choose to use your bread maker, as well. the times listed reflect making the buns manually.",
