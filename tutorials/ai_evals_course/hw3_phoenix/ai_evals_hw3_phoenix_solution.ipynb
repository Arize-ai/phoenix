    "ground_truth_explanation\": \"The recipe attempts to modify a traditional fruit cake to be more diabetic-friendly by using natural sweeteners like erythritol or monk fruit sweetener instead of sugar, and unsweetened dried fruits. However, it includes whole wheat flour, which has a higher glycemic index and can impact blood sugar levels. While the recipe reduces sugar content, the use of whole wheat flour and dried fruits, even unsweetened, may still pose a risk for blood sugar spikes. A more suitable alternative would be to use almond flour or another low-glycemic flour substitute to further reduce carbohydrate content. Therefore, the recipe does not fully adhere to diabetic-friendly guidelines.\",\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ground Truth Label:** FAIL\n",

    "\n",
    "**Predicted Explanation:** The recipe provides a diabetic-friendly modification for traditional fruit cake by reducing sugar, using natural sweeteners like erythritol or monk fruit, incorporating unsweetened dried fruits, and adding fiber-rich whole wheat flour. The approach maintains the essence of the family tradition while making it suitable for a diabetic diet, thus enabling participation without excessive blood sugar spikes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ground Truth Explanation:** The recipe attempts to modify a traditional fruit cake to be more suitable for someone with diabetes by reducing sugar content and using sugar substitutes. However, there are several concerns that make it not fully diabetic-friendly. **Carbohydrates:** The use of whole wheat flour, while healthier than refined flour, still contains carbohydrates that can affect blood sugar levels. **Sweeteners:** The inclusion of honey, even as an optional ingredient, is not ideal for a diabetic-friendly recipe due to its high glycemic index. **Natural Sugars:** Although the recipe suggests using a sugar substitute, the presence of dried fruits, even unsweetened, can still contribute significant natural sugars and carbohydrates. **Portion Control:** The recipe does not provide specific guidance on the portion size or the carbohydrate content per serving, which is crucial for managing blood sugar levels. Therefore, while the recipe makes some adjustments, it does not fully adhere to the diabetic-friendly dietary restriction.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Ground Truth Label:** FAIL\n",
    "\n",
    "**Predicted Label:** PASS\n",

    "**Predicted Explanation:** The modified recipe reduces added sugar by replacing it with natural sweeteners like honey or sugar substitutes and suggests selecting dried fruits with lower sugar content. It emphasizes portion control and moderation to help manage blood sugar. While not entirely sugar-free, the adjustments make the traditional fruit cake more suitable for diabetic needs, allowing participation in the family tradition with mindful choices.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ground Truth Explanation:** The recipe for Honey Garlic Chicken with Roasted Vegetables includes honey as an ingredient, which is not compliant with Whole30 guidelines. **Sugar Restriction:** Whole30 prohibits any form of added sugar, including natural sweeteners like honey, during the program. **Ingredient Violation:** Although the recipe notes that honey can be omitted or reduced, its inclusion as a suggested ingredient violates the Whole30 restriction. Therefore, the recipe does not fully adhere to the Whole30 dietary restriction.\n",

    "**Predicted Explanation:** The recipe provided is Whole30 compliant, using approved ingredients such as chicken, coconut aminos (a Whole30 substitute for soy sauce), apple cider vinegar, garlic, vegetables, and olive oil. The only consideration is honey, which is technically not compliant during a strict Whole30. However, for a dinner that can be enjoyed by both Whole30 and non-Whole30 eaters, using honey is acceptable in moderation or can be omitted. Overall, the recipe aligns well with Whole30 standards and is designed to appeal to someone who is not on Whole30, making it a suitable suggestion.\n",

    "**Predicted Explanation:** The recipe uses natural ingredients like apples, cinnamon, walnuts, and optional honey, avoiding artificial sweeteners. Although honey is a natural sweetener, it is high in carbohydrates and not ideal for strict diabetic dietary restrictions. However, if omitted or replaced with lower glycemic sweeteners, this dessert can be suitable for diabetics. The recipe does not include artificial sweeteners or high-GI ingredients, making it a generally diabetic-friendly option when prepared appropriately.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ground Truth Explanation:** The recipe for Baked Apples with Cinnamon and Walnuts includes ingredients that may not be ideal for a diabetic-friendly diet. **Natural Sugars:** While the apples themselves are a natural source of sugar, the addition of honey or maple syrup, even as optional, can significantly increase the glycemic load of the dessert. **Sweetener Issues:** Diabetic-friendly recipes should focus on minimizing sugar content, and using honey or maple syrup contradicts this requirement. **High Glycemic Ingredients:** Additionally, rolled oats, though optional, can also contribute to a higher glycemic index. Therefore, the recipe does not fully adhere to the diabetic-friendly dietary restriction.\n",

The approach yields a dough that is both gluten-free and enjoyable, avoiding the typical cardboard texture often associated with gluten-free crusts.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ground Truth Explanation**: While the recipe does not contain wheat or barley, it includes malt extract for flavoring. Ingredient Violation: Malt extract is derived from barley and contains gluten, making the dough unsuitable for a gluten-free diet. Without understanding that malt extract is a gluten-containing ingredient, the model incorrectly assumes the recipe complies fully with gluten-free guidelines.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Ground Truth Explanation**: While the recipe avoids grains, dairy, and legumes, it includes green peas in the roasted vegetable mix. Ingredient Violation: The Paleo diet excludes legumes, which include green peas, due to their high antinutrient content and carbohydrate profile. The model fails to recognize that green peas are considered legumes and therefore non-compliant with paleo dietary rules. As a result, the recipe does not fully adhere to the paleo restriction."

    "#### Key insights from failures\n",
    "- Our evaluator does not have precise information on the different dietary restrictions. For example it makes mistakes on technicalities related to gluten-free diets and Paleo diets. \n",

    "- Let's include the definitions for all of our dietary restrictions. This will ensure the model is fully informed on all the precise details of every dietary restriction, which will help it correctly classify queries. \n",
    "- Let's tell the model to not include any optional ingredients that would violate the user's query and dietary restriction.\n",
    "- Let's add some few shot examples from the training set so that our model knows how to understand honey. \n",

    "From researching about prompting strategies we also know that few shot learning is helpful in general cases. It's also an intuitive way to leverage our training set! Up until now, we were just trying out prompts and not using our training set to build these prompts. But through experimentation and research about prompting, we have arrived at a good way to use it.
