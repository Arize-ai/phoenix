# Phoenix ServerAgent Harbor evaluation

## Run

Install the Phoenix client with its Harbor integration on Python 3.12 or newer:

```bash
pip install "arize-phoenix-client[harbor]"
```

Build Phoenix and stage the wheel and container assets (from the repository root):

```bash
make harbor-stage-environments
```

Validate with the bundled oracle:

```bash
make harbor-oracle
```

Run the real ServerAgent adapter:

```bash
make harbor-run
```

Test the Harbor plugin against a local Phoenix server with the direct task path used by
the PXI workflow:

```bash
make dev-backend
# In another terminal:
uv build --wheel packages/phoenix-client
CLIENT_WHEEL=$(ls dist/arize_phoenix_client-*.whl)
uvx --python 3.13 --from 'harbor[daytona]==0.21.0' --with "$CLIENT_WHEEL" \
  harbor run -p evals/harbor/tasks/regression-triage -a oracle -e docker \
  --plugin arize-phoenix \
  --plugin-kwarg endpoint=http://127.0.0.1:6006 \
  --plugin-kwarg trace_mode=none \
  --yes
```

A single direct task uses `harbor-task/<declared task name>` as its Phoenix dataset.
For several direct tasks, pass `--plugin-kwarg dataset=<name>` to name the synthetic
dataset explicitly.

Both trial targets accept overrides, e.g.:

```bash
make harbor-run HARBOR_TASK=evals/harbor/tasks/regression-triage \
  HARBOR_MODEL=anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5 \
  HARBOR_ENV=docker \
  HARBOR_ATTEMPTS=1
```

Run the Phoenix plugin end-to-end matrix with:

```bash
make harbor-plugin-e2e
```

The command requires Docker. It builds the current client wheel, starts an isolated Phoenix
server, and exercises dataset snapshots, experiment runs, repetitions, multiple agents, resume,
and startup failures with Harbor 0.21.0. Successful runs remove their temporary workspace. Failed
runs print and retain the workspace path for investigation. Set `HARBOR_E2E_KEEP=1` to retain a
successful run as well.

Browse job results in a local web viewer:

```bash
make harbor-view
```

Optionally export traces to a remote Phoenix instance:

```bash
export HARBOR_PHOENIX_COLLECTOR_ENDPOINT=https://your-phoenix.example.com
export HARBOR_PHOENIX_API_KEY=...
export HARBOR_PHOENIX_PROJECT_NAME=harbor-server-agent-evals
```

## Publish fixtures

```bash
make harbor-publish-fixtures
```
