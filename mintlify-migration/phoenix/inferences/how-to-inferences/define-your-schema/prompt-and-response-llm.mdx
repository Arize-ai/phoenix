For the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) use case, see the [Retrieval](/phoenix/inferences/how-to-inferences/define-your-schema/retrieval-rag) section.

## Dataframe

Below shows a relevant subsection of the dataframe. The `embedding` of the prompt is also shown.

| prompt                                           | embedding                      | response              |
| ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------ | --------------------- |
| who was the first person that walked on the moon | \[-0.0126, 0.0039, 0.0217, ... | Neil Alden Armstrong  |
| who was the 15th prime minister of australia     | \[0.0351, 0.0632, -0.0609, ... | Francis Michael Forde |

## Schema

See [Retrieval](/phoenix/inferences/how-to-inferences/define-your-schema/retrieval-rag) for the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) use case where relevant documents are retrieved for the question before constructing the context for the LLM.

```javascript
primary_schema = Schema(
    prediction_id_column_name="id",
    prompt_column_names=EmbeddingColumnNames(
        vector_column_name="embedding",
        raw_data_column_name="prompt",
    )
    response_column_names="response",
)
```

## Inferences

Define the inferences by pairing the dataframe with the schema.

```
primary_inferences = px.Inferences(primary_dataframe, primary_schema)
```

## Application

```
session = px.launch_app(primary_inferences)
```
