title: "Amazon Bedrock tracing"
description: Instrument LLM calls to AWS Bedrock via the boto3 client using the BedrockInstrumentor
---

boto3 provides Python bindings to AWS services, including Bedrock, which provides access to a number of foundation models. Calls to these models can be instrumented using OpenInference, enabling OpenTelemetry-compliant observability of applications built using these models. Traces collected using OpenInference can be viewed in Phoenix.

OpenInference Traces collect telemetry data about the execution of your LLM application. Consider using this instrumentation to understand how a Bedrock-managed models are being called inside a complex system and to troubleshoot issues such as extraction and response synthesis.

## Launch Phoenix
<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Phoenix Cloud">
    **Sign up for Phoenix:**

    1. Sign up for an Arize Phoenix account at [https://app.phoenix.arize.com/login](https://app.phoenix.arize.com/login)

    2. Click `Create Space`, then follow the prompts to create and launch your space.

    **Install packages:**

    ``` bash
    pip install arize-phoenix-otel
    ```

    **Set your Phoenix endpoint and API Key:**

    From your new Phoenix Space

    1. Create your API key from the Settings page

    2. Copy your `Hostname` from the Settings page

    3. In your code, set your endpoint and API key:

    ```python
    import os

    os.environ["PHOENIX_API_KEY"] = "ADD YOUR PHOENIX API KEY"
    os.environ["PHOENIX_COLLECTOR_ENDPOINT"] = "ADD YOUR PHOENIX HOSTNAME"

    # If you created your Phoenix Cloud instance before June 24th, 2025,
    # you also need to set the API key as a header:
    # os.environ["PHOENIX_CLIENT_HEADERS"] = f"api_key={os.getenv('PHOENIX_API_KEY')}"
    ```

    </Info>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Command Line">
    **Launch your local Phoenix instance:**

    ``` bash
    pip install arize-phoenix
    phoenix serve
    ```

    For details on customizing a local terminal deployment, see [Terminal Setup](https://arize.com/docs/phoenix/setup/environments#terminal).

    **Install packages:**

    ``` bash
    pip install arize-phoenix-otel
    ```

    **Set your Phoenix endpoint:**

    ```javascript
    import os

    os.environ["PHOENIX_COLLECTOR_ENDPOINT"] = "http://localhost:6006"
    ```

    See [Terminal](https://arize.com/docs/phoenix/environments#terminal) for more details.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Docker">
    **Pull latest Phoenix image from** [**Docker Hub**](https://hub.docker.com/r/arizephoenix/phoenix)**:**

    ```bash
    docker pull arizephoenix/phoenix:latest
    ```

    **Run your containerized instance:**

    ```bash
    docker run -p 6006:6006 arizephoenix/phoenix:latest
    ```

    This will expose the Phoenix on `localhost:6006`

    **Install packages:**

    ``` bash
    pip install arize-phoenix-otel
    ```

    **Set your Phoenix endpoint:**

    ```javascript
    import os

    os.environ["PHOENIX_COLLECTOR_ENDPOINT"] = "http://localhost:6006"
    ```

    For more info on using Phoenix with Docker, see [Docker](https://arize.com/docs/phoenix/self-hosting/deployment-options/docker).
  </Tab>
    <Tab title="Notebook">
    **Install packages:**

    ``` bash
    pip install arize-phoenix
    ```

    **Launch Phoenix:**

    ```javascript
    import phoenix as px
    px.launch_app()
    ```

    <Info>
    By default, notebook instances do not have persistent storage, so your traces will disappear after the notebook is closed. See [self-hosting](https://arize.com/docs/phoenix/self-hosting) or use one of the other deployment options to retain traces.

## Install

```bash
pip install openinference-instrumentation-bedrock opentelemetry-exporter-otlp
```

## Setup

Connect to your Phoenix instance using the register function.

```python
from phoenix.otel import register

# configure the Phoenix tracer
tracer_provider = register(
  project_name="my-llm-app", # Default is 'default'
  auto_instrument=True # Auto-instrument your app based on installed OI dependencies
)
```

After connecting to your Phoenix server, instrument `boto3` prior to initializing a `bedrock-runtime` client. All clients created after instrumentation will send traces on all calls to `invoke_model`.

```java
import boto3

session = boto3.session.Session()
client = session.client("bedrock-runtime")
```

## Run Bedrock

From here you can run Bedrock as normal

```swift
prompt = (
    b'{"prompt": "Human: Hello there, how are you? Assistant:", "max_tokens_to_sample": 1024}'
)
response = client.invoke_model(modelId="anthropic.claude-v2", body=prompt)
response_body = json.loads(response.get("body").read())
print(response_body["completion"])
```

## Observe

Now that you have tracing setup, all calls to invoke\_model will be streamed to your running Phoenix for observability and evaluation.
