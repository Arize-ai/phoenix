This notebook serves as an end-to-end example of how to trace and evaluate an agent. The example uses a "talk-to-your-data" agent as its example.

The notebook shows examples of:

* Manually instrumenting an agent using Phoenix decorators
* Evaluating function calling accuracy using LLM as a Judge
* Evaluating function calling accuracy by comparing to ground truth
* Evaluating SQL query generation
* Evaluating Python code generation
* Evaluating the path of an agent

## Notebook Walkthrough

We will go through key code snippets on this page. To follow the full tutorial, check out the full notebook.

## Prepare dataset

Your agent will interact with a local database. Start by loading in that data:

```python
store_sales_df = pd.read_parquet(
    "https://storage.googleapis.com/arize-phoenix-assets/datasets/unstructured/llm/llama-index/Store_Sales_Price_Elasticity_Promotions_Data.parquet"
)
store_sales_df.head()
```

## Define the tools

Now you can define your agent tools.

#### Tool 1: Database Lookup

````python
SQL_GENERATION_PROMPT = """
Generate an SQL query based on a prompt. Do not reply with anything besides the SQL query.
The prompt is: {prompt}

The available columns are: {columns}
The table name is: {table_name}
"""


def generate_sql_query(prompt: str, columns: list, table_name: str) -> str:
    """Generate an SQL query based on a prompt"""
    formatted_prompt = SQL_GENERATION_PROMPT.format(
        prompt=prompt, columns=columns, table_name=table_name
    )

    response = client.chat.completions.create(
        model=model,
        messages=[{"role": "user", "content": formatted_prompt}],
    )

    return response.choices[0].message.content


@tracer.tool()
def lookup_sales_data(prompt: str) -> str:
    """Implementation of sales data lookup from parquet file using SQL"""

        table_name = "sales"
        # Read the parquet file into a DuckDB table
        duckdb.sql(f"CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS {table_name} AS SELECT * FROM store_sales_df")

        print(store_sales_df.columns)
        print(table_name)
        sql_query = generate_sql_query(prompt, store_sales_df.columns, table_name)
        sql_query = sql_query.strip()
        sql_query = sql_query.replace("```sql", "").replace("```", "")

        with tracer.start_as_current_span(
            "execute_sql_query", openinference_span_kind="chain"
        ) as span:
            span.set_input(value=sql_query)

            # Execute the SQL query
            result = duckdb.sql(sql_query).df()
            span.set_output(value=str(result))
            span.set_status(StatusCode.OK)
        return result.to_string()
    except Exception as e:
        return f"Error accessing data: {str(e)}"
````

```python
example_data = lookup_sales_data("Show me all the sales for store 1320 on November 1st, 2021")

#### Tool 2: Data Visualization

````python

@tracer.chain()
def create_chart(config: VisualizationConfig) -> str:
    """Create a chart based on the configuration"""
    prompt = f"""Write python code to create a chart based on the following configuration.

    config = extract_chart_config(data, visualization_goal)
    code = create_chart(config)
    return code
````

```python

```

```python

        return "Code executed successfully"

    except Exception as e:
        return f"Error executing code: {str(e)}"

#### Tool 3: Data Analysis

```python
@tracer.tool()
def analyze_sales_data(prompt: str, data: str) -> str:
    """Implementation of AI-powered sales data analysis"""
    # Construct prompt based on analysis type and data subset
    prompt = f"""Analyze the following data: {data}
    Your job is to answer the following question: {prompt}"""

    response = client.chat.completions.create(
        model=model,
        messages=[{"role": "user", "content": prompt}],
    )

    analysis = response.choices[0].message.content
    return analysis if analysis else "No analysis could be generated"
```

```python
analysis = analyze_sales_data("What is the most popular product SKU?", example_data)
```

#### Tool Schema:

You'll need to pass your tool descriptions into your agent router. The following code allows you to easily do so:

```python
# Define tools/functions that can be called by the model
tools = [
    {
        "type": "function",
        "function": {

                    },
                },
                "required": ["data", "visualization_goal"],

    #         }
    #     }
    # }
]

# Dictionary mapping function names to their implementations
tool_implementations = {
    "lookup_sales_data": lookup_sales_data,
    "analyze_sales_data": analyze_sales_data,
    "generate_visualization": generate_visualization,
    # "run_python_code": run_python_code
}
```

## Agent logic

With the tools defined, you're ready to define the main routing and tool call handling steps of your agent.

```python
@tracer.chain()
def handle_tool_calls(tool_calls, messages):
    for tool_call in tool_calls:
        function = tool_implementations[tool_call.function.name]
        function_args = json.loads(tool_call.function.arguments)
        result = function(**function_args)

        messages.append({"role": "tool", "content": result, "tool_call_id": tool_call.id})
    return messages
```

```python
def start_main_span(messages):
    print("Starting main span with messages:", messages)

    with tracer.start_as_current_span("AgentRun", openinference_span_kind="agent") as span:
        span.set_input(value=messages)
        ret = run_agent(messages)
        print("Main span completed with return value:", ret)
        span.set_output(value=ret)
        span.set_status(StatusCode.OK)
        return ret


def run_agent(messages):
    print("Running agent with messages:", messages)
    if isinstance(messages, str):
        messages = [{"role": "user", "content": messages}]
        print("Converted string message to list format")

    # Check and add system prompt if needed
    if not any(
        isinstance(message, dict) and message.get("role") == "system" for message in messages
    ):
        system_prompt = {
            "role": "system",
            "content": "You are a helpful assistant that can answer questions about the Store Sales Price Elasticity Promotions dataset.",
        }
        messages.append(system_prompt)
        print("Added system prompt to messages")

    while True:
        # Router call span
        print("Starting router call span")
        with tracer.start_as_current_span(
            "router_call",
            openinference_span_kind="chain",
        ) as span:
            span.set_input(value=messages)

            response = client.chat.completions.create(
                model=model,
                messages=messages,
                tools=tools,
            )

            messages.append(response.choices[0].message.model_dump())
            tool_calls = response.choices[0].message.tool_calls
            print("Received response with tool calls:", bool(tool_calls))
            span.set_status(StatusCode.OK)

            if tool_calls:
                # Tool calls span
                print("Processing tool calls")
                messages = handle_tool_calls(tool_calls, messages)
                span.set_output(value=tool_calls)
            else:
                print("No tool calls, returning final response")
                span.set_output(value=response.choices[0].message.content)

                return response.choices[0].message.content
```

## Run the agent

Your agent is now good to go! Let's try it out with some example questions:

```python
ret = start_main_span([{"role": "user", "content": "Create a line chart showing sales in 2021"}])
print(Markdown(ret))
```

```python
agent_questions = [
    "What was the most popular product SKU?",
    "What was the total revenue across all stores?",
    "Which store had the highest sales volume?",
    "Create a bar chart showing total sales by store",
    "What percentage of items were sold on promotion?",
    "Plot daily sales volume over time",
    "What was the average transaction value?",
    "Create a box plot of transaction values",
    "Which products were frequently purchased together?",
    "Plot a line graph showing the sales trend over time with a 7-day moving average",
]

for question in tqdm(agent_questions, desc="Processing questions"):
    try:
        ret = start_main_span([{"role": "user", "content": question}])
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error processing question: {question}")
        print(e)
        continue
```

![Agent Traces](https://storage.googleapis.com/arize-phoenix-assets/assets/images/agent-traces.png)

## Evaluating the agent

So your agent looks like it's working, but how can you measure its performance?

```python
OpenAIInstrumentor().uninstrument()  # Uninstrument the OpenAI client to avoid capturing LLM as a Judge evaluation calls in your same project.
```

```python
import nest_asyncio

import phoenix as px
from phoenix.evals import TOOL_CALLING_PROMPT_TEMPLATE, OpenAIModel, llm_classify
from phoenix.experiments import evaluate_experiment, run_experiment
from phoenix.experiments.evaluators import create_evaluator
from phoenix.experiments.types import Example
from phoenix.trace import SpanEvaluations
from phoenix.trace.dsl import SpanQuery

nest_asyncio.apply()
```

```python
px_client = px.Client()
eval_model = OpenAIModel(model="gpt-4o-mini")
```

## Function Calling Evals using LLM as a Judge

This first evaluation will evaluate your agent router choices using another LLM.

It follows a standard pattern:

1. Export traces from Phoenix
2. Prepare those exported traces in a dataframe with the correct columns
3. Use `llm_classify` to run a standard template across each row of that dataframe and produce an eval label
4. Upload the results back into Phoenix

```python
query = (
    SpanQuery()
    .where(
        "span_kind == 'LLM'",
    )
    .select(question="input.value", output_messages="llm.output_messages")
)

# The Phoenix Client can take this query and return the dataframe.
tool_calls_df = px.Client().query_spans(query, project_name=project_name, timeout=None)
tool_calls_df.dropna(subset=["output_messages"], inplace=True)


def get_tool_call(outputs):
    if outputs[0].get("message").get("tool_calls"):
        return (
            outputs[0]
            .get("message")
            .get("tool_calls")[0]
            .get("tool_call")
            .get("function")
            .get("name")
        )
    else:
        return "No tool used"


tool_calls_df["tool_call"] = tool_calls_df["output_messages"].apply(get_tool_call)
tool_calls_df.head()
```

```python
tool_call_eval = llm_classify(
    dataframe=tool_calls_df,
    template=TOOL_CALLING_PROMPT_TEMPLATE.template.replace(
        "{tool_definitions}",
        "generate_visualization, lookup_sales_data, analyze_sales_data, run_python_code",
    ),
    rails=["correct", "incorrect"],
    model=eval_model,
    provide_explanation=True,
)

tool_call_eval["score"] = tool_call_eval.apply(
    lambda x: 1 if x["label"] == "correct" else 0, axis=1
)

tool_call_eval.head()
```

```python
px.Client().log_evaluations(
    SpanEvaluations(eval_name="Tool Calling Eval", dataframe=tool_call_eval),
)
```

You should now see eval labels in Phoenix.

## Function Calling Evals using Ground Truth

The above example works, however if you have ground truth labled data, you can use that data to get an even more accurate measure of your router's performance by running an experiments.

Experiments also follow a standard step-by-step process in Phoenix:

1. Create a dataset of test cases, and optionally, expected outputs
2. Create a task to run on each test case - usually this is invoking your agent or a specifc step of it
3. Create evaluator(s) to run on each output of your task
4. Visualize results in Phoenix

```python
import uuid

id = str(uuid.uuid4())

agent_tool_responses = {
    "What was the most popular product SKU?": "lookup_sales_data, analyze_sales_data",
    "What was the total revenue across all stores?": "lookup_sales_data, analyze_sales_data",
    "Which store had the highest sales volume?": "lookup_sales_data, analyze_sales_data",
    "Create a bar chart showing total sales by store": "generate_visualization, lookup_sales_data, run_python_code",
    "What percentage of items were sold on promotion?": "lookup_sales_data, analyze_sales_data",
    "Plot daily sales volume over time": "generate_visualization, lookup_sales_data, run_python_code",
    "What was the average transaction value?": "lookup_sales_data, analyze_sales_data",
    "Create a box plot of transaction values": "generate_visualization, lookup_sales_data, run_python_code",
    "Which products were frequently purchased together?": "lookup_sales_data, analyze_sales_data",
    "Plot a line graph showing the sales trend over time with a 7-day moving average": "generate_visualization, lookup_sales_data, run_python_code",
}


tool_calling_df = pd.DataFrame(agent_tool_responses.items(), columns=["question", "tool_calls"])
dataset = px_client.upload_dataset(
    dataframe=tool_calling_df,
    dataset_name=f"tool_calling_ground_truth_{id}",
    input_keys=["question"],
    output_keys=["tool_calls"],
)
```

For your task, you can simply run just the router call of your agent:

```python
def run_router_step(example: Example) -> str:
    messages = [
        {
            "role": "system",
            "content": "You are a helpful assistant that can answer questions about the Store Sales Price Elasticity Promotions dataset.",
        }
    ]
    messages.append({"role": "user", "content": example.input.get("question")})

    response = client.chat.completions.create(
        model=model,
        messages=messages,
        tools=tools,
    )
    tool_calls = []
    for tool_call in response.choices[0].message.tool_calls:
        tool_calls.append(tool_call.function.name)
    return tool_calls
```

Your evaluator can also be simple, since you have expected outputs. If you didn't have those expected outputs, you could instead use an LLM as a Judge here, or even basic code:

```python
def tools_match(expected: str, output: str) -> bool:
    expected_tools = expected.get("tool_calls").split(", ")
    return expected_tools == output
```

```python
experiment = run_experiment(
    dataset,
    run_router_step,
    evaluators=[tools_match],
    experiment_name="Tool Calling Eval",
    experiment_description="Evaluating the tool calling step of the agent",
)

The next piece of your agent to evaluate is its tools. Each tool is usually evaluated differently - we've included some examples below. If you need other ideas, [Phoenix's built-in evaluators](https://arize.com/docs/phoenix/evaluation/how-to-evals/running-pre-tested-evals) give you an idea of other metrics to use.

#### Evaluating our SQL generation tool

```python
# This step will be replaced by a human annotated set of ground truth data, instead of generated examples

db_lookup_questions = [
    "What was the most popular product SKU?",
    "Which store had the highest total sales value?",
    "How many items were sold on promotion?",
    "What was the average quantity sold per transaction?",
    "Which product class code generated the most revenue?",
    "What day of the week had the highest sales volume?",
    "How many unique stores made sales?",
    "What was the highest single transaction value?",
    "Which products were frequently sold together?",
    "What's the trend in sales over time?",
]

expected_results = []

for question in tqdm(db_lookup_questions, desc="Processing SQL lookup questions"):
    try:
        with suppress_tracing():
            expected_results.append(lookup_sales_data(question))
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error processing question: {question}")
        print(e)
        db_lookup_questions.remove(question)

# Create a DataFrame with the questions
questions_df = pd.DataFrame({"question": db_lookup_questions, "expected_result": expected_results})

display(questions_df)
```

```python
dataset = px_client.upload_dataset(
    dataframe=questions_df,
    dataset_name=f"sales_db_lookup_questions_{id}",
    input_keys=["question"],
    output_keys=["expected_result"],
)
```

```python
def run_sql_query(example: Example) -> str:
    with suppress_tracing():
        return lookup_sales_data(example.input.get("question"))
```

```python
def evaluate_sql_result(output: str, expected: str) -> bool:
    # Extract just the numbers from both strings
    result_nums = "".join(filter(str.isdigit, output))
    expected_nums = "".join(filter(str.isdigit, expected.get("expected_result")))
    return result_nums == expected_nums
```

```python
experiment = run_experiment(
    dataset,
    run_sql_query,
    evaluators=[evaluate_sql_result],
    experiment_name="SQL Query Eval",
    experiment_description="Evaluating the SQL query generation step of the agent",
)
```

#### Evaluating our Python code generation tool

```python
# Replace this with a human annotated set of ground truth data, instead of generated examples

code_generation_questions = [
    "Create a bar chart showing total sales by store",
    "Plot daily sales volume over time",
    "Plot a line graph showing the sales trend over time with a 7-day moving average",
    "Create a histogram of quantities sold per transaction",
    "Generate a pie chart showing sales distribution across product classes",
    "Create a stacked bar chart showing promotional vs non-promotional sales by store",
    "Generate a heatmap of sales by day of week and store number",
    "Plot a line chart comparing sales trends between top 5 stores",
]

example_data = []
chart_configs = []
for question in tqdm(code_generation_questions[:], desc="Processing code generation questions"):
    try:
        with suppress_tracing():
            example_data.append(lookup_sales_data(question))
            chart_configs.append(json.dumps(extract_chart_config(example_data[-1], question)))
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error processing question: {question}")
        print(e)
        code_generation_questions.remove(question)

code_generation_df = pd.DataFrame(
    {
        "question": code_generation_questions,
        "example_data": example_data,
        "chart_configs": chart_configs,
    }
)

dataset = px_client.upload_dataset(
    dataframe=code_generation_df,
    dataset_name=f"code_generation_questions_{id}",
    input_keys=["question", "example_data", "chart_configs"],
)
```

```python
def run_code_generation(example: Example) -> str:
    with suppress_tracing():
        chart_config = extract_chart_config(
            data=example.input.get("example_data"), visualization_goal=example.input.get("question")
        )
        code = generate_visualization(
            visualization_goal=example.input.get("question"), data=example.input.get("example_data")
        )

    return {"code": code, "chart_config": chart_config}
```

In this case, you don't have ground truth data to compare to. Instead you can just use a simple code evaluator: trying to run the generated code and catching any errors.

````python
def code_is_runnable(output: str) -> bool:
    """Check if the code is runnable"""
    output = output.get("code")
    output = output.strip()
    output = output.replace("```python", "").replace("```", "")
    try:
        exec(output)
        return True
    except Exception:
        return False
````

```python
def evaluate_chart_config(output: str, expected: str) -> bool:
    return output.get("chart_config") == expected.get("chart_config")
```

```python
experiment = run_experiment(
    dataset,
    run_code_generation,
    evaluators=[code_is_runnable, evaluate_chart_config],
    experiment_name="Code Generation Eval",
    experiment_description="Evaluating the code generation step of the agent",
)
```

## Evaluating the agent path and convergence

Finally, the last piece of your agent to evaluate is its path. This is important to evaluate to understand how efficient your agent is in its execution. Does it need to call the same tool multiple times? Does it skip steps it shouldn't, and have to backtrack later? Convergence or path evals can tell you this.

Convergence evals operate slightly differently. The one you'll use below relies on knowing the minimum number of steps taken by the agent for a given type of query. Instead of just running an experiment, you'll run an experiment then after it completes, attach a second evaluator to calculate convergence.

The workflow is as follows:

1. Create a dataset of the same type of question, phrased different ways each time - the agent should take the same path for each, but you'll often find it doesn't.
2. Create a task that runs the agent on each question, while tracking the number of steps it takes.
3. Run the experiment without an evaluator.
4. Calculate the minimum number of steps taken to complete the task.
5. Create an evaluator that compares the steps taken of each run against that min step number.
6. Run this evaluator on your experiment from step 3.
7. View your results in Phoenix

```python
# Replace this with a human annotated set of ground truth data, instead of generated examples

convergence_questions = [
    "What was the average quantity sold per transaction?",
    "What is the mean number of items per sale?",
    "Calculate the typical quantity per transaction",
    "Show me the average number of units sold in each transaction",
    "What's the mean transaction size in terms of quantity?",
    "On average, how many items were purchased per transaction?",
    "What is the average basket size per sale?",
    "Calculate the mean number of products per purchase",
    "What's the typical number of units per order?",
    "Find the average quantity of items in each transaction",
    "What is the average number of products bought per purchase?",
    "Tell me the mean quantity of items in a typical transaction",
    "How many items does a customer buy on average per transaction?",
    "What's the usual number of units in each sale?",
    "Calculate the average basket quantity per order",
    "What is the typical amount of products per transaction?",
    "Show the mean number of items customers purchase per visit",
    "What's the average quantity of units per shopping trip?",
    "How many products do customers typically buy in one transaction?",
    "What is the standard basket size in terms of quantity?",
]

convergence_df = pd.DataFrame({"question": convergence_questions})

dataset = px_client.upload_dataset(
    dataframe=convergence_df, dataset_name="convergence_questions", input_keys=["question"]
)
```

```python
def format_message_steps(messages):
    """

    Args:

## Advanced - Combining all the evals into our experiment

As an optional final step, you can combine all the evaluators and experiments above into a single experiment. This requires some more advanced data wrangling, but gives you a single report on your agent's performance.

#### Build a version of our agent that tracks all the necessary information for evals

CLARITY_LLM_JUDGE_PROMPT = """
In this task, you will be presented with a query and an answer. Your objective is to evaluate the clarity
of the answer in addressing the query. A clear response is one that is precise, coherent, and directly
addresses the query without introducing unnecessary complexity or ambiguity. An unclear response is one
that is vague, disorganized, or difficult to understand, even if it may be factually correct.

Your response should be a single word: either "clear" or "unclear," and it should not include any other
text or characters. "clear" indicates that the answer is well-structured, easy to understand, and
appropriately addresses the query. "unclear" indicates that the answer is ambiguous, poorly organized, or
not effectively communicated. Please carefully consider the query and answer before determining your
response.

After analyzing the query and the answer, you must write a detailed explanation of your reasoning to
justify why you chose either "clear" or "unclear." Avoid stating the final label at the beginning of your
explanation. Your reasoning should include specific points about how the answer does or does not meet the
criteria for clarity.

In this task, you will be presented with a query and an answer. Your objective is to determine whether all

entity refers to any specific person, place, organization, date, or other proper noun. Your evaluation
should focus on whether the entities in the answer are correctly named and appropriately associated with
the context in the query.

Your response should be a single word: either "correct" or "incorrect," and it should not include any
other text or characters. "correct" indicates that all entities mentioned in the answer match those in the
query and are properly identified. "incorrect" indicates that the answer contains errors or mismatches in
the entities referenced compared to the query.

After analyzing the query and the answer, you must write a detailed explanation of your reasoning to
