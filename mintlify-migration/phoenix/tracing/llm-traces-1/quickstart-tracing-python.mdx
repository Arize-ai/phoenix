## Overview

Phoenix supports three main options to collect traces:

1. Use [Phoenix's decorators](/phoenix/tracing/how-to-tracing/setup-tracing/instrument-python) to mark functions and code blocks.

2. Use [automatic instrumentation](https://arize.com/docs/phoenix/integrations) to capture all calls made to supported frameworks.

3. Use [base OpenTelemetry](/phoenix/tracing/how-to-tracing/setup-tracing/custom-spans) instrumentation. Supported in [Python](/phoenix/tracing/how-to-tracing/setup-tracing/custom-spans) and [TS / JS](/phoenix/tracing/how-to-tracing/setup-tracing/javascript), among many other languages.

This example uses options 1 and 2.

## Launch Phoenix

<Tabs>

  <Tab title="Using Phoenix Cloud">

    **Sign up for Phoenix:**

    1. Sign up for an Arize Phoenix account at [https://app.phoenix.arize.com/login](https://app.phoenix.arize.com/login)

    2. Click `Create Space`, then follow the prompts to create and launch your space.

    **Install packages:**

    ```
    pip install arize-phoenix-otel
    ```

    **Set your Phoenix endpoint and API Key:**

    From your new Phoenix Space

    1. Create your API key from the Settings page

    2. Copy your `Hostname` from the Settings page

    3. In your code, set your endpoint and API key:

    ```python
    import os

    os.environ["PHOENIX_API_KEY"] = "ADD YOUR PHOENIX API KEY"
    os.environ["PHOENIX_COLLECTOR_ENDPOINT"] = "ADD YOUR PHOENIX HOSTNAME"

    # If you created your Phoenix Cloud instance before June 24th, 2025,
    # you also need to set the API key as a header
    #os.environ["PHOENIX_CLIENT_HEADERS"] = f"api_key={os.getenv('PHOENIX_API_KEY')}"
    ```

    </Info>

  </Tab> 

  <Tab title="Using Self-hosted Phoenix">

    1. Run Phoenix using Docker, local terminal, Kubernetes etc. For more information, [see self-hosting](https://arize.com/docs/phoenix/self-hosting).

    2. In your code, set your endpoint:

    ```python
    import os

    # Update this with your self-hosted endpoint
    os.environ["PHOENIX_COLLECTOR_ENDPOINT"] = "http://localhost:6006/v1/traces"
    ```

## Connect to Phoenix

To collect traces from your application, you must configure an OpenTelemetry TracerProvider to send traces to Phoenix.

```sh
pip install arize-phoenix-otel
```

```python
from phoenix.otel import register

# configure the Phoenix tracer
tracer_provider = register(
  project_name="my-llm-app", # Default is 'default'
  auto_instrument=True, # See 'Trace all calls made to a library' below
)
tracer = tracer_provider.get_tracer(__name__)
```

## Trace your own functions

Functions can be traced using decorators:

```python
@tracer.chain
def my_func(input: str) -> str:
    return "output"
```

Input and output attributes are set automatically based on `my_func`'s parameters and return.

## Trace all calls made to a library

Phoenix can also capture all calls made to supported libraries automatically. Just install the [respective OpenInference library](https://github.com/Arize-ai/phoenix/blob/docs/docs/tracing/llm-traces-1/broken-reference/README.md):

```sh
pip install openinference-instrumentation-openai
```

<Warning>
OpenInference libraries must be installed ***before*** calling the register function

</Warning>

```python
# Add OpenAI API Key
import os
import openai

os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "ADD YOUR OPENAI API KEY"

client = openai.OpenAI()
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-4o",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Write a haiku."}],
)
print(response.choices[0].message.content)
```

## View your Traces in Phoenix

You should now see traces in Phoenix!
