title: "How do i resolve Phoenix evals showing NOT_PARSABLE?"
---

`NOT_PARSABLE` errors often occur when LLM responses exceed the `max_tokens` limit or produce incomplete JSON. Here's how to fix it:

1. Increase `max_tokens`: Update the model configuration as follows:

   ```python
   pythonCopy codellm_judge_model = OpenAIModel(
       api_key=getpass("Enter your OpenAI API key..."),
       model="gpt-4o-2024-08-06",
       temperature=0.2,
       max_tokens=1000,  # Increase token limit
   )
   ```

2. Update Phoenix: Use version â‰¥0.17.4, which removes token limits for OpenAI and increases defaults for other APIs.

3. Check Logs: Look for `finish_reason="length"` to confirm token limits caused the issue.

4. If the above doesn't work, it's possible the llm-as-a-judge output might not fit into the defined rails for that particular custom Phoenix eval. Double check the prompt output matches the rail expectations.
