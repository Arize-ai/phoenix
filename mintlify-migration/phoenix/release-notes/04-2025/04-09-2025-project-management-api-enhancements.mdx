<Update label="04.09.2025">

## Project Management API Enhancements

This update enhances the Project Management API with more flexible project identification:

* **Enhanced project identification**: Added support for identifying projects by both ID and hex-encoded name and introduced a new `_get_project_by_identifier` helper function

Also includes streamlined operations, better validation & error handling, and expanded test coverage.
