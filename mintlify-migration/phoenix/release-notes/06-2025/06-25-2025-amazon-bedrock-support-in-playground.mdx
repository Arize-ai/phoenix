Phoenix's Playground now supports Amazon Bedrock, allowing users to run prompts directly against Bedrock-hosted models within the platform.

**New Features:**

* Run prompts on Amazon Bedrock models seamlessly from Phoenix's Playground.

* Compare outputs side-by-side with other model providers for better evaluation.

* Instantly track usage metrics, latency, and cost associated with Bedrock models.

* Fine-tune prompt strategies within Phoenix without needing to switch tools.
