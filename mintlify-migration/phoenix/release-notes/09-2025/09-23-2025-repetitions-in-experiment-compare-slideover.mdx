This change enhances the experiment compare slideover by breaking out repeated runs into their own cards, making it easier to see individual repetitions. A sidebar is added so users can toggle the visibility of each repetition. Additionally, the UI and data model were refactored to better support repetition-aware and repetition-naive modes.&#x20;
