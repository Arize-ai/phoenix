In this update, the Experiment Lists page has received several user-facing enhancements to improve usability and responsiveness.

**New Features:**

* Input and output columns on the Experiment Lists page are now resizable, improving layout flexibility.
* Virtualization has been enabled for the Experiment Lists view, helping performance when many experiments are shown.
* Tooltips were enhanced so full input/output content can be previewed
* Text truncation now adjusts dynamically based on column width, making content more readable.
* Fixed duplicate-key UI errors and improved spacing when progress bars are absent to clean up visual layout.
