title: "Access control (RBAC)"
---

The role-based access control (RBAC) in Phoenix is based on the following user roles:

* `admin` - full control to the system, can administer users, system keys, etc.

* `member` - a developer that can add traces, experiments, datasets, etc.

A user's role controls their access via the UI as well as through the APIs.
