title: "Can I run Phoenix on Sagemaker?"
description: "With SageMaker notebooks, phoenix leverages the jupyter-server-proy to host the server under `proxy/6006.`Note, that phoenix will automatically try to detect that you are running in SageMaker but you can declare the notebook runtime via a parameter to `launch_app` or an environment variable"

```python
import os

os.environ["PHOENIX_NOTEBOOK_ENV"] = "sagemaker"
```
