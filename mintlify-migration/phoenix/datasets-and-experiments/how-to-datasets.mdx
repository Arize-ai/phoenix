## How to create datasets

Datasets are critical assets for building robust prompts, evals, fine-tuning, and much more. Phoenix allows you to build datasets manually, programmatically, or from files.

* [Create datasets from CSV](/phoenix/datasets-and-experiments/how-to-datasets/creating-datasets#from-csv)

* [Create datasets from Pandas](/phoenix/datasets-and-experiments/how-to-datasets/creating-datasets#create-datasets-from-pandas)

* [Create datasets from spans](/phoenix/datasets-and-experiments/how-to-datasets/creating-datasets#from-spans)

* [Create datasets using synthetic data](/phoenix/datasets-and-experiments/how-to-datasets/creating-datasets#syntetic-data)

## Exporting datasets

Export datasets for offline analysis, evals, and fine-tuning.

* [Exporting to CSV](/phoenix/datasets-and-experiments/how-to-datasets/exporting-datasets#exporting-to-csv) - how to quickly download a dataset to use elsewhere

* [Exporting to OpenAI Ft](/phoenix/datasets-and-experiments/how-to-datasets/exporting-datasets#exporting-for-fine-tuning) - want to fine tune an LLM for better accuracy and cost? Export llm examples for fine-tuning.

* [Exporting to OpenAI Evals](/phoenix/datasets-and-experiments/how-to-datasets/exporting-datasets#exporting-openai-evals) - have some good examples to use for benchmarking of llms using OpenAI evals? export to OpenAI evals format.
