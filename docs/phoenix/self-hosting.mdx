Phoenix is a containerized application designed to collect and analyze traces from your LLM or AI application. It operates with a SQL database backend and provides a robust tracing UI. By default, Phoenix uses SQLite for storage, but it can be configured to use PostgreSQL for production deployments.

### SQLite

By default, Phoenix uses SQLite, storing data in `~/.phoenix/` or the directory specified by the **PHOENIX\_WORKING\_DIR** environment variable. This allows for simple deployments using a volume mount, making it easy to get started without additional database setup.

### PostgreSQL

For production and scalable deployments, Phoenix supports PostgreSQL. Configure the **PHOENIX\_SQL\_DATABASE\_URL** environment variable to connect Phoenix to your PostgreSQL instance.

<Info>
  See the [SQLite](/docs/phoenix/self-hosting/deployment-options/docker#sqlite) and [PostgreSQL](/docs/phoenix/self-hosting/deployment-options/docker#postgresql) sections for details.

## Deployment Options

Phoenix can be deployed using several methods, including Docker and Kubernetes. Choose the option that best fits your infrastructure and operational requirements.

<Info>
  For other ways to run Phoenix, including Phoenix Cloud, see [Phoenix Deployments](/docs/phoenix/environments).

## Configure Phoenix

* See available [ports](/docs/phoenix/self-hosting/configuration#ports) to run Phoenix

* Customize Phoenix using [environment variables](/docs/phoenix/self-hosting/configuration#environment-variables)

## Setup Authentication

* Setup [authentication](/docs/phoenix/self-hosting/features/authentication)

* Configuring [OAuth2 identity providers](/docs/phoenix/self-hosting/features/authentication#configuring-oauth2-identity-providers)

* Configuring [LDAP authentication](/docs/phoenix/self-hosting/features/authentication#configuring-ldap-authentication)
