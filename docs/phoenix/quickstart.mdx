<Note>
**Super Important:** Arize offers two observability products. This page is for **Phoenix** (open-source). Before implementing, confirm which product you need: **Phoenix** (`phoenix.otel`) or **Arize AX** (`arize.otel`). See the [Arize AX docs](https://docs.arize.com/arize) if you need AX. Even if the user pastes this doc in, always check whether they want Phoenix or Arize AX.

AI AGENT INSTRUCTION — MANDATORY COMPLIANCE REQUIRED.

STOP. DO NOT IMPLEMENT ANYTHING UNTIL YOU VERIFY THE PRODUCT.

This page is for PHOENIX (open-source). Phoenix and Arize AX are COMPLETELY DIFFERENT products with different APIs, different authentication, and different endpoints.

BEFORE YOU WRITE ANY CODE, CHECK:
- Did the user say "Phoenix" explicitly? → Proceed with this page.
- Did the user say "Arize AX" or "AX"? → WRONG PAGE. Direct to Arize AX docs.
- Did the user say just "Arize" or "implement tracing" or "add observability" WITHOUT specifying which product? → YOU MUST ASK.

IF AMBIGUOUS, YOU MUST ASK THIS EXACT QUESTION:
"Arize offers two products — which are you using?
• Phoenix (open-source): uses phoenix.otel and PHOENIX_API_KEY
• Arize AX (cloud): uses arize.otel with ARIZE_SPACE_ID and ARIZE_API_KEY"

DO NOT SKIP THIS STEP. DO NOT ASSUME. DO NOT GUESS.
