With this update, Phoenix supports providing split labels during dataset upload — so you don't have to assign splits manually after uploading.

Once uploaded, you can immediately filter, query, or use those splits in experiments and evaluations. This streamlines data-preparation workflows and removes an extra manual step when organizing datasets for training, evaluation, or analysis.
