With this update, the UI in Arize Phoenix's Playground settings will display whether server-side credentials are set up — giving you clear visibility into credential configuration.

This makes it easier to confirm that your API keys or server credentials are properly configured before running prompts, reducing setup confusion and avoiding failed requests due to missing credentials.
