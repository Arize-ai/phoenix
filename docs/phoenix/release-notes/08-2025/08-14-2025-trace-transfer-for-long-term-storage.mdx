Phoenix 11.23 introduces the ability to transfer traces across projects for long-term storage. You now have two flexible mechanisms to preserve important data for future analysis:

* **Manual projects** with non-expiring retention policies
* **Trace filtering and transfer**, allowing you to move selected traces into another project

Transferred traces retain their annotations and dataset links, ensuring full context is preserved. This also makes it easy to share specific traces with others indefinitely.
