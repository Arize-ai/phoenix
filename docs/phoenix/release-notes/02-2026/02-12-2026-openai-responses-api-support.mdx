Phoenix now supports selecting the **OpenAI API type** for OpenAI and Azure OpenAI calls in the Playground and custom providers.

**Key capabilities:**

- **API type selection:** Choose **Chat Completions** (`chat.completions.create`) or **Responses** (`responses.create`) per model configuration.
- **Custom provider support:** OpenAI and Azure OpenAI custom providers can be configured with an API type for consistent routing.
- **Parameter compatibility:** Phoenix maps shared invocation parameters to the chosen API type and filters unsupported fields automatically.

To get started, open the model configuration panel in the Playground and select an **OpenAI API type**. For server-managed setups, configure the API type in **Settings → AI Providers → Custom Providers**.
