# Claude Opus 4.6 Model Support

February 9, 2026

Phoenix playground now supports Claude Opus 4.6, Anthropic's latest flagship model. Select `claude-opus-4-6` in the Anthropic provider or `anthropic.claude-opus-4-6-v1` in AWS Bedrock to start using the model with full extended thinking parameter support and accurate cost tracking.

**Key capabilities:**

- **Anthropic provider integration:** Access Claude Opus 4.6 directly through the playground with the `thinking` invocation parameter enabled for extended reasoning workflows
- **AWS Bedrock support:** Deploy Opus 4.6 through Bedrock with the region-specific model identifier
- **Automatic cost tracking:** Token costs are calculated using the latest pricing ($5 per million input tokens, $25 per million output tokens, plus cache read/write rates)

The model appears in playground dropdowns alongside other Claude models and inherits the same reasoning capabilities as other Claude 4.x models.
