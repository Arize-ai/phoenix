In Arize Phoenix, _splits_ let you categorize your dataset into distinct subsets—such as **train**, **validation**, or **test**—enabling structured workflows for experiments and evaluations. This capability offers more flexibility in how you organize, filter, and compare your data across different stages or experimental conditions.

You can **query dataset examples by splits**, allowing you to focus experiments on specific subsets of your dataset.
