Phoenix now allows you to track token-based costs for LLM runs automatically, calculating costs from token counts and model pricing data and rolling them up to trace and project levels for comprehensive analysis.

**New Features:**

* Automatic calculation of token-based costs using Phoenix's built-in model pricing table.
* Support for custom pricing configurations in **Settings > Models** when needed.
* Token counts and model information are captured automatically when using OpenInference auto-instrumentation with OpenAI, Anthropic, and other supported SDKs.
* For manual instrumentation, token count attributes can be included in spans to enable cost tracking.
* OpenTelemetry users can leverage OpenInference semantic conventions to include token counts in LLM spans.
