We're excited to announce that Phoenix can now be deployed via a Helm chart for Kubernetes.

This allows you to:

* **Quickly spin up Phoenix** with a single `helm install` and a single YAML file.
* **Launch using the infrastructure and deployment patterns recommended by the Phoenix team**, ensuring consistency and ease of maintenance.
* **Easily upgrade** to the latest Phoenix features and improvements over time.

Whether you are self-hosting in a cloud Kubernetes cluster or on-premises, the new Helm chart makes deploying Phoenix simpler and more reliable than ever.
