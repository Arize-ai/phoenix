Phoenix v9.0.0 release brings major updates to annotation support, and a whole host of other improvements.

## [Annotations](/docs/phoenix/tracing/llm-traces/how-to-annotate-traces) 🏷️

Up until now, Phoenix has only supported one annotation of a given type on each trace. We've now unlocked that limit, allowing you to capture multiple values of an annotation label on each span.

In addition, we've added:

* API support for annotations - create, query, and update annotations through the REST API
* Additional support for code evaluations as annotations
* Support for arbitrary metadata on annotations
* Annotation configurations to structure your annotations within and across projects

## [Data Retention](/docs/phoenix/settings/data-retention) 💿

Now you can create custom global and per-project data retention polices to remove traces after a certain window of time, or based on number of traces. Additionally, you can now view your disk usage in the Settings page of Phoenix.

## Hotkeys 🔥

We've added hotkeys to Phoenix!

You can now use `j` and `k` to quickly page through your traces, and `e` and `n` to add annotations and notes - you never have to lift your hands off the keyboard again!
