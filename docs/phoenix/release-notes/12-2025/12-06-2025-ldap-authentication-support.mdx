## LDAP Authentication

Phoenix now supports authentication against LDAP directories, enabling integration with enterprise identity infrastructure including:

- **Microsoft Active Directory**
- **OpenLDAP**
- **389 Directory Server**
- Any LDAP v3 compliant directory

**Key Features:**

* Authenticate users with their corporate directory credentials
* Automatic user provisioning on first login
* Group-based role mapping (ADMIN, MEMBER, VIEWER)
* Support for nested groups in Active Directory
* Multi-server failover for high availability
* TLS encryption with StartTLS and LDAPS support
* Mutual TLS (client certificate) authentication
* Custom CA certificate support for internal PKI

**Configuration Highlights:**

* Simple setup with just `PHOENIX_LDAP_HOST` and `PHOENIX_LDAP_USER_SEARCH_BASE`
* Flexible group-to-role mappings via JSON configuration
* Support for both AD-style `memberOf` and POSIX group lookups
* Optional immutable unique identifiers for user tracking
