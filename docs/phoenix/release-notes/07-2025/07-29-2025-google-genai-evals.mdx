We've added support for the `GoogleGenAIModel` in `phoenix-evals`, enabling direct access to Google's Gemini models through the official Google GenAI SDK. As of late 2024, this is the recommended approach for working with Gemini, offering a unified interface across both the Developer API and VertexAI.

**🚀 Key Features**

* **Multimodal Support**

    Run evaluations on **text**, **image**, and **audio** inputs using Gemini's multimodal capabilities.

* **Async-Ready**

    Optimized for **high-throughput evals** with full **async** compatibility.

* **Flexible Authentication**

    Supports both **API key** and **VertexAI-based** authentication methods.

* **Dynamic Rate Limiting**

    Built-in **rate limiter** with automatic adjustment based on API feedback and usage patterns.

This integration makes it easier to run robust, scalable evaluations using Gemini models directly within your `phoenix-evals` workflows.
