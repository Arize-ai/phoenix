**Datasets**: Datasets are a new core feature in Phoenix that live alongside your projects. They can be imported, exported, created, curated, manipulated, and viewed within the platform, and should make a few flows much easier:

* Fine-tuning: You can now create a dataset based on conditions in the UI, or by manually choosing examples, then export these into CSV or JSONL formats ready-made for fine-tuning APIs.

* Experimentation: External datasets can be uploaded into Phoenix to serve as the test cases for experiments run in the platform.

For more details on using datasets see our [documentation](/docs/phoenix/datasets-and-experiments/overview-datasets?utm_campaign=Phoenix%20Newsletter\&utm_source=hs_email\&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9Tx_lYbuasbD3Mzdwl0VNPcvy_YcbPudxu1qwBZ3T7Mh---A4PO-OJfhas-RR4Ys_IEb0F) or [example notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1e4vZR5VPelXXYGtWfvM3CErPhItHAIp2?usp=sharing\&utm_campaign=Phoenix%20Newsletter\&utm_source=hs_email\&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9Tx_lYbuasbD3Mzdwl0VNPcvy_YcbPudxu1qwBZ3T7Mh---A4PO-OJfhas-RR4Ys_IEb0F).

**Experiments:** Our new Datasets and Experiments feature enables you to create and manage datasets for rigorous testing and evaluation of your models. You can now run comprehensive experiments to measure and analyze the performance of your LLMs in various scenarios.
