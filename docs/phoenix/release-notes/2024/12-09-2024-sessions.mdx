Sessions allow you to group multiple responses into a single thread. Each response is still captured as a single trace, but each trace is linked together and presented in a combined view.

Sessions make it easier to visual multi-turn exchanges with your chatbot or agent Sessions launches with Python and TS/JS support. For more on sessions, check out [a walkthrough video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzS6x0BE-EU) and the [docs](/docs/phoenix/tracing/how-to-tracing/setup-tracing/setup-sessions).
