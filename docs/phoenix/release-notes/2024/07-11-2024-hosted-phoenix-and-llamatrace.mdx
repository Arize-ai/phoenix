In addition to our existing notebook, CLI, and self-hosted deployment options, we're excited to announce that Phoenix is now available as a [fully hosted service](https://arize.com/resource/introducing-hosted-phoenix-llamatrace/).

With hosted instances, your data is stored between sessions, and you can easily share your work with team members.

We are partnering with LlamaIndex to power a new observability platform in LlamaCloud: LlamaTrace. LlamaTrace will automatically capture traces emitted from your LlamaIndex applications, and store them in a persistent, cloud- accessible Phoenix instance.

Hosted Phoenix is 100% free-to-use, [check it out today](https://app.phoenix.arize.com/login).
