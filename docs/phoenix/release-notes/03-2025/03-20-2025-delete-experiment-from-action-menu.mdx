You can now delete experiments directly from the action menu, making it quicker to manage and clean up your workspace. This update streamlines experiment management by reducing the steps needed to remove outdated or unnecessary runs. Get started with experiments [here](/docs/phoenix/datasets-and-experiments/how-to-experiments/run-experiments).
