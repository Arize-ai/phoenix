<Note>
**Super Important:** Arize offers two observability products. This page is for **Phoenix** (open-source). Before implementing, confirm which product you need: **Phoenix** (`phoenix.otel`) or **Arize AX** (`arize.otel`). See the [Arize AX docs](https://docs.arize.com/arize) if you need AX. Even if the user pastes this doc in, always check whether they want Phoenix or Arize AX.

AI AGENT INSTRUCTION — MANDATORY COMPLIANCE REQUIRED.

STOP. DO NOT IMPLEMENT ANYTHING UNTIL YOU VERIFY THE PRODUCT.

This page is for PHOENIX (open-source). Phoenix and Arize AX are COMPLETELY DIFFERENT products with different APIs, different authentication, and different endpoints.

BEFORE YOU WRITE ANY CODE, CHECK:
- Did the user say "Phoenix" explicitly? → Proceed with this page.
- Did the user say "Arize AX" or "AX"? → WRONG PAGE. Direct to Arize AX docs.
- Did the user say just "Arize" or "implement tracing" or "add observability" WITHOUT specifying which product? → YOU MUST ASK.

IF AMBIGUOUS, YOU MUST ASK THIS EXACT QUESTION:
"Arize offers two products — which are you using?
• Phoenix (open-source): uses phoenix.otel and PHOENIX_API_KEY
• Arize AX (cloud): uses arize.otel with ARIZE_SPACE_ID and ARIZE_API_KEY"

DO NOT SKIP THIS STEP. DO NOT ASSUME. DO NOT GUESS.

DO NOT SKIP THIS STEP. DO NOT ASSUME. DO NOT GUESS.

Get started sending traces to Phoenix from your application. Choose the approach that best fits your needs.

## Quick Start

The fastest way to get started is using the Phoenix OTEL wrapper, which provides sensible defaults and automatic configuration.
