# Log to a specific project

Phoenix uses projects to group traces. If left unspecified, all traces are sent to a default project.

<Tabs>

  <Tab title="Using Phoenix Wrappers">

    In the notebook, you can set the `PHOENIX_PROJECT_NAME` environment variable **before** adding instrumentation or running any of your code.

    In python this would look like:

    ```javascript
    import os

    os.environ['PHOENIX_PROJECT_NAME'] = "<your-project-name>"
    ```

    <Warning>
    Note that setting a project via an environment variable only works in a notebook and must be done **BEFORE** instrumentation is initialized. If you are using OpenInference Instrumentation, see the Server tab for how to set the project name in the Resource attributes.

    </Warning>

    Alternatively, you can set the project name in your `register` function call:

    ```javascript
    from phoenix.otel import register

    tracer_provider = register(
        project_name="my-project-name",
        ....
    )
    ```

  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Using OTEL Directly">

    If you are using Phoenix as a collector and running your application separately, you can set the project name in the `Resource` attributes for the trace provider.

    ```python expandable
    from openinference.semconv.resource import ResourceAttributes
    from openinference.instrumentation.llama_index import LlamaIndexInstrumentor
    from opentelemetry import trace as trace_api
    from opentelemetry.exporter.otlp.proto.http.trace_exporter import OTLPSpanExporter
    from opentelemetry.sdk import trace as trace_sdk
    from opentelemetry.sdk.resources import Resource
    from opentelemetry.sdk.trace.export import SimpleSpanProcessor

    resource = Resource(attributes={
        ResourceAttributes.PROJECT_NAME: '<your-project-name>'
    })
    tracer_provider = trace_sdk.TracerProvider(resource=resource)
    span_exporter = OTLPSpanExporter(endpoint="http://phoenix:6006/v1/traces")
    span_processor = SimpleSpanProcessor(span_exporter=span_exporter)
    tracer_provider.add_span_processor(span_processor=span_processor)
    trace_api.set_tracer_provider(tracer_provider=tracer_provider)
    # Add any auto-instrumentation you want
    LlamaIndexInstrumentor().instrument()
    ```

  </Tab>

</Tabs>

Projects work by setting something called the **Resource** attributes (as seen in the OTEL example above). The phoenix server uses the project name attribute to group traces into the appropriate project.

# Switching projects in a notebook

Typically you want traces for an LLM app to all be grouped in one project. However, while working with Phoenix inside a notebook, we provide a utility to temporarily associate spans with different projects. You can use this to trace things like evaluations.

    ```python
    from openinference.instrumentation import dangerously_using_project

    # Switch project to run evals
    with dangerously_using_project("my-eval-project"):
        # all spans created within this context will be associated with
        # the "my-eval-project" project.
        # Run evaluations here...
    ```
