Sessions enable tracking and organizing related traces across multi-turn conversations with your AI application. When building conversational AI, maintaining context between interactions is critical - Sessions make this possible from an observability perspective.

With Sessions in Phoenix, you can:

* Track the entire history of a conversation in a single thread

* View conversations in a chatbot-like UI showing inputs and outputs of each turn

* Search through sessions to find specific interactions

* Track token usage and latency per conversation

This feature is particularly valuable for applications where context builds over time, like chatbots, virtual assistants, or any other multi-turn interaction. By tagging spans with a consistent session ID, you create a connected view that reveals how your application performs across an entire user journey.
