    To create a new API key, go to the **API Keys** section within **Settings**. Click the **Add System Key** button, then provide a name for your API key. You may also include an optional description and set an expiration date if desired. All your API keys will be listed and manageable in this section.

    ### System vs User API Keys
    - System API keys represent the actions taken by the system as a whole

    - User API keys represent the actions of a particular user. They are tied to lifespan of the user that created them.

  <Step title={<span className="step-title">Add Collaborators</span>}>
    Phoenix Cloud supports team collaboration by allowing you to add members to your space. You can also assign roles to control access. 


    ### Roles
    - **Admins** have full control over the space, including managing members, settings, system and user API keys, and roles.
    - **Members** can access their own profile and manage their own user API keys 

    ### Adding Collaborators 
    On the Settings page, click the **Add User** button. Enter the user’s name, email address, and assign a role. The user will receive an email invitation to log in to the Phoenix instance.
