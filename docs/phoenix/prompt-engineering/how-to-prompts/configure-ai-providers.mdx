title: "Configure AI Providers"
description: "Phoenix natively integrates with OpenAI, Azure OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google AI Studio (gemini) to make it easy to test changes to your prompts. In addition to the above, since many AI providers (deepseek, ollama) can be used directly with the OpenAI client, you can talk to any OpenAI compatible LLM provider."

## Credentials

To securely provide your API keys, you have two options. One is to store them in your browser in local storage. Alternatively, you can set them as environment variables on the server side. If both are set at the same time, the credential set in the browser will take precedence.

### Option 1: Store API Keys in the Browser

API keys can be entered in the playground application via the API Keys dropdown menu. This option stores API keys in the browser. Simply navigate to to settings and set your API keys.

### Option 2: Set Environment Variables on Server Side

*Available on self-hosted Phoenix*

If the following variables are set in the server environment, they'll be used at API invocation time.

| Provider     | Environment Variable                                                         | Platform Link                                                                                                                                    |

<Info>
For Azure, you can also set the following server-side environment variables: `AZURE_TENANT_ID`, `AZURE_CLIENT_ID`, and `AZURE_FEDERATED_TOKEN_FILE` to use [WorkloadIdentityCredential](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/python/api/azure-identity/azure.identity.workloadidentitycredential?view=azure-python).

</Info>

<Info>
**AWS Bedrock Authentication**

When using AWS Bedrock, Phoenix leverages the standard [boto3 credential chain](https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/guide/credentials.html) or the `AWS_BEARER_TOKEN_BEDROCK` environment variable. This means if you are running Phoenix on an EC2 instance with an assigned IAM role, have `~/.aws/credentials` configured, or have exported `AWS_BEARER_TOKEN_BEDROCK`, you do not need to explicitly provide credentials.

To use this fallback behavior, **do not fill out the AWS credentials in the Playground settings**. The client will automatically discover and use the available credentials from the environment.
</Info>

## Using OpenAI Compatible LLMs

### Option 1: Configure the base URL in the prompt playground

Since you can configure the base URL for the OpenAI client, you can use the prompt playground with a variety of OpenAI Client compatible LLMs such as **Ollama**, **DeepSeek**, and more.\\

<Frame caption="Simply insert the URL for the OpenAI client compatible LLM provider">
  <img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/arize-phoenix-assets/assets/images/phoenix-docs-images/ca5e3fd5-image.jpeg" />
</Frame>

<Info>
If you are using an LLM provider, you will have to set the OpenAI api key to that provider's api key for it to work.

</Info>

OpenAI Client compatible providers Include

| Provider | Base URL                                                 | Docs                                                                                                                   |

| DeepSeek | [https://api.deepseek.com](https://api.deepseek.com)    | [https://api-docs.deepseek.com/](https://api-docs.deepseek.com/)                                                       |
| Ollama   | [http://localhost:11434/v1/](http://localhost:11434/v1/) | [https://github.com/ollama/ollama/blob/main/docs/openai.md](https://github.com/ollama/ollama/blob/main/docs/openai.md) |

### Option 2: Server side configuration of the OpenAI base URL

Optionally, the server can be configured with the `OPENAI_BASE_URL` environment variable to change target any OpenAI compatible REST API.

<Warning>
For app.phoenix.arize.com, this may fail due to security reasons. In that case, you'd see a Connection Error appear.

If there is a LLM endpoint you would like to use, reach out to [mailto://phoenix-support@arize.com](mailto://phoenix-support@arize.com)

</Warning>

<Info>
OpenAI and Azure OpenAI support two API types: **Chat Completions** (`chat.completions.create`) and **Responses** (`responses.create`). For built-in providers, choose the API type from the model configuration panel in the Playground. For custom providers, set the API type in the provider configuration. Built-in providers default to Chat Completions, while custom providers default to Responses.
</Info>

## Custom Providers

Custom providers let you store provider credentials and routing settings on the server and reuse them across the playground and prompt versions. This is ideal for shared environments where you want a single, managed configuration instead of per-browser API keys or ephemeral routing fields.

![Custom provider configuration in Phoenix](https://storage.googleapis.com/arize-phoenix-assets/assets/images/custom-provider-config.png)

To create a custom provider:

1. Go to **Settings** → **AI Providers**.
2. In **Custom Providers**, select **New Provider**.
3. Enter a **Name** and a **Provider String**.
4. Choose the **SDK** and fill in the required fields.
5. Click **Test** to validate the credentials, then **Create Provider**.

### Supported SDKs and Fields

**OpenAI**
Required: API key, API type (Chat Completions or Responses)
Optional: Base URL, Organization, Project, Default headers

**Azure OpenAI**
Required: Endpoint, authentication method
API key auth: API key
AD token provider auth: Tenant ID, Client ID, Client Secret (Scope optional)
Default credentials auth: Endpoint only
Optional: Default headers

**Anthropic**
Required: API key
Optional: Base URL, Default headers

**AWS Bedrock**
Required: Region, authentication method
Access keys auth: Access Key ID, Secret Access Key (Session Token optional)
Default credentials auth: Region only
Optional: Endpoint URL

**Google GenAI**
Required: API key
Optional: Base URL, Headers

### Using Custom Providers in the Playground and Prompts

Custom providers appear in model selection menus as their own provider group. When you select one:

1. The model list mirrors the built-in model list for that SDK.
2. Routing fields (base URL, Azure endpoint, AWS region) are pulled from the custom provider config.
3. You can still add request-level custom headers from the model configuration panel.

Prompt versions and evaluators use custom providers when a prompt version is saved with a custom provider selection. If you do not select a custom provider for a prompt, Phoenix falls back to environment variables or saved secrets for the built-in provider.


## Custom Headers

Phoenix supports adding custom HTTP headers to requests sent to AI providers. This is useful for additional credentials, routing needs, or cost tracking when using custom LLM proxies.

### Configuring Custom Headers

1. Click on the model configuration button in the playground
2. Scroll down to the "Custom Headers" section
3. Add your headers in JSON format:

```json
{
  "application-name": "phoenix"
}
```
