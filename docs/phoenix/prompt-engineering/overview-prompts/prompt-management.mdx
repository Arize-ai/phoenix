Prompt management allows you to create, store, and modify prompts for interacting with LLMs. By managing prompts systematically, you can improve reuse, consistency, and experiment with variations across different models and inputs.

Key benefits of prompt management include:

* **Reusability**: Store and load prompts across different use cases.

* **Versioning**: Track changes over time to ensure that the best performing version is deployed for use in your application.

* **Collaboration**: Share prompts with others to maintain consistency and facilitate iteration.
