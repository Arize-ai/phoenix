## Setup

### Step 1: Download the Migration Tool

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Arize-ai/phoenix-to-ax-migration
cd phoenix-to-ax-migration
```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 3: Configure Environment

Create a `.env` file with your configuration:

```bash
# Phoenix (include PHOENIX_API_KEY if using Phoenix Cloud)
PHOENIX_ENDPOINT="https://app.phoenix.arize.com/s/your-space-name"
PHOENIX_API_KEY=your-phoenix-api-key 

# Arize
ARIZE_API_KEY=your-arize-api-key
ARIZE_SPACE_ID=your-arize-space-id

# Export directory where Phoenix data will be saved locally
PHOENIX_EXPORT_DIR="phoenix_export"
```

<Info>
You can find your Arize API key and Space ID in your Arize AX account settings.

## Supported Data Types

| Data Type | Details |
|-----------|------------------------|
| **Datasets & Experiments** | • All datasets and their corresponding experiments<br/>• Experiment evaluations not yet migrated |
| **Project Traces** | • Contains traces, evaluation, and human annotations |

## ⚠️ Import Warning for Annotations ⚠️

* **Wait for traces to be indexed**: After importing traces, you must wait a few minutes for them to be loaded and indexed in Arize AX before sending annotation data. The import process will prompt you to verify traces are available before proceeding with annotations.

* **31-day window**: Only annotations for traces from the past 31 days can be logged to Arize. If your traces are older than 31 days, their annotations will be skipped with a warning message.


## Usage

### Export from Phoenix

```bash
# Export everything
python export_all_projects.py --all

# Export specific types
python export_all_projects.py --de      # datasets and experiments
python export_all_projects.py --traces   # traces with evaluations and annotations
```

### Import to Arize

```bash
# Import everything
python import_to_arize.py --all

# Import specific types
python import_to_arize.py --de      # datasets and experiments
python import_to_arize.py --traces  # traces with evaluations and annotations
```

## Generated Files

After export and import, you'll see this structure:

```
phoenix_export/ # All data lives here
├── datasets/
│   ├── datasets.json
│   ├── dataset_{id}_examples.json
│   └── dataset_{id}_experiments.json
└── projects/

        ├── project_metadata.json
        ├── traces.json
        ├── evaluations.json
        └── annotations.json

├── dataset_experiment_export_results.json
├── dataset_experiment_import_results.json

└── trace_import_results.json
```

## Troubleshooting

### Import issues with traces

The formatting of some span attributes may not be compatible between Arize and Phoenix. We tried to cover as many cases as possible, but there may be some missing ones. If you encounter errors:

1. Check the `results/` folder to see what errors have occured
2. Fix them in the project's `traces.json` file
3. Re-import the data to Arize

### Import issues with annotations

* Wait for traces to be fully indexed in Arize AX before importing annotations
* Check that your traces are within the 31-day window
* Review the `results/` folder for detailed error messages

### For Large Projects and Datasets

* Be patient - large imports can take time
* Monitor the `results/` folder for progress
