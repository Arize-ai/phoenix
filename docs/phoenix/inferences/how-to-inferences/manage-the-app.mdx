## Define Your Inferences

<Info>
For a conceptual overview of inferences, including an explanation of when to use a single inference vs. primary and reference inferences, see Phoenix Basics.

</Info>

To define inferences, you must load your data into a pandas dataframe and [create a matching schema](/phoenix/inferences/how-to-inferences/define-your-schema). If you have a dataframe `prim_df` and a matching `prim_schema`, you can define inferences named "primary" with

```py
prim_ds = px.Inferences(prim_df, prim_schema, "primary")
```

If you additionally have a dataframe `ref_df` and a matching `ref_schema`, you can define a inference set named "reference" with

```py
ref_ds = px.Inferences(ref_df, ref_schema, "reference")
```

See [Corpus Data](/phoenix/inferences/how-to-inferences/define-your-schema/corpus-data) if you have corpus data for an Information Retrieval use case.

## Launch the App

Use `phoenix.launch_app` to start your Phoenix session in the background. You can launch Phoenix with zero, one, or two inference sets.

<CardGroup>
<Card title="No Inferences" >

```py
session = px.launch_app()
```

• Run Phoenix in the background to collect OpenInference traces emitted by your instrumented LLM application.

</Card>
<Card title="Single Inference Set" >

```py
session = px.launch_app(ds)
```

• Analyze a single cohort of data, e.g., only training data.

• Check model performance and data quality, but not drift.

</Card>
<Card title="Primary and Reference Inference Sets" >

```py
session = px.launch_app(prim_ds, ref_ds)
```

• Compare cohorts of data, e.g., training vs. production.

• Analyze drift in addition to model performance and data quality.

</Card>
<Card title="Primary and Corpus Inference Sets" >
    
```py
session = px.launch_app(query_ds, corpus=corpus_ds)
```

• Compare a query inference set to a corpus dataset to analyze your retrieval-augmented generation applications.

## Open the UI

You can view and interact with the Phoenix UI either directly in your notebook or in a separate browser tab or window.

<Tabs>
<Tab title="In the Browser">
    
In a notebook cell, run

```py
session.url
```

Copy and paste the output URL into a new browser tab or window.

<Info>
Browser-based sessions are supported in both local Jupyter environments and Colab.

</Info>

</Tab>
<Tab title="In Your Notebook">
    
In a notebook cell, run

```py
session.view()
```

The Phoenix UI will appear in an inline frame in the cell output.

<Info>
The height of the window can be adjusted by passing a `height` parameter, e.g., `session.view(height=1200)`. Defaults to 1000 pixels.

</Info>

## Close the App

When you're done using Phoenix, gracefully shut down your running background session with

```py
px.close_app()
```
