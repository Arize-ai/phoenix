## 🛠️ Develop

During the development phase, Phoenix offers essential tools for debugging, experimentation, evaluation, prompt tracking, and search and retrieval.

<Tabs>

  <Tab title="Traces">

    ### Traces for Debugging

    <Frame>

    </Frame>

    Phoenix's tracing and span analysis capabilities are invaluable during the prototyping and debugging stages. By instrumenting application code with Phoenix, teams gain detailed insights into the execution flow, making it easier to identify and resolve issues. Developers can drill down into specific spans, analyze performance metrics, and access relevant logs and metadata to streamline debugging efforts.

  <Tab title="Experimentation">

    ### Experimentation

    <Frame>

    </Frame>

    Leverage experiments to measure prompt and model performance. Typically during this early stage, you'll focus on gathering a robust set of test cases and evaluation metrics to test initial iterations of your application. Experiments at this stage may resemble unit tests, as they're geared towards ensuring your application performs correctly.

  <Tab title="Evaluation">

    ### Evaluation

    <Frame>

    </Frame>

    Either as a part of experiments or a standalone feature, evaluations help you understand how your app is performing at a granular level. Typical evaluations might be correctness evals compared against a ground truth data set, or LLM-as-a-judge evals to detect hallucinations or relevant RAG output.

  <Tab title="Prompt Engineering">

    ### Prompt Engineering

    <Frame>
      <img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/arize-phoenix-assets/assets/gifs/playground_3.gif"/>
    </Frame>

    Prompt engineering is critical to how a model behaves. While there are other methods such as fine-tuning to change behavior, prompt engineering is the simplest way to get started and often has the best ROI.

    * [Overview: Prompts](/docs/phoenix/prompt-engineering/overview-prompts)

    Instrument prompt and prompt variable collection to associate iterations of your app with the performance measured through evals and experiments. Phoenix tracks prompt templates, variables, and versions during execution to help you identify improvements and degradations.

    </Frame>

    Phoenix's search and retrieval optimization tools include an embeddings visualizer that helps teams understand how their data is being represented and clustered. This visual insight can guide decisions on indexing strategies, similarity measures, and data organization to improve the relevance and efficiency of search results.
