description: Seamlessly migrate your data from Phoenix to Arize AX
---

## Overview

This migration tool helps you move your data from Phoenix to Arize AX in just a few simple steps. It transfers:

* 📊 **Projects and Traces** - Your observability data

* 📝 **Annotations** - Feedback data

* 🎯 **Datasets** - Training and test data

* 🤖 **Prompts** - Prompt templates

* 📈 **Evaluations** - Performance metrics

<Info>
The migration happens in two steps: first export from Phoenix, then import to Arize AX.

</Info>

## What You Need

* Access to your Phoenix instance

* An Arize AX Pro account

* Python installed on your computer

## Getting Started

### Step 1: Download the Migration Tool

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Dylancouzon/phoenix2ax
cd phoenix2ax
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Note:** This migration tool was created by an Arize team member for the community, but it is **not an official Arize package**.

### Step 2: Configure Your Settings

1. Copy the example configuration file:

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

2. Edit the `.env` file with your details:

   ```python
   # Your Phoenix instance
   PHOENIX_ENDPOINT=https://your-phoenix-instance.com
   PHOENIX_API_KEY=your-phoenix-api-key

   # Your Arize AX account
   ARIZE_API_KEY=your-arize-api-key
   ARIZE_SPACE_ID=your-arize-space-id
   ```

<Info>
You can find your Arize API key and Space ID in your Arize AX account settings.

</Info>

### Step 3: Export Your Data from Phoenix

Run this command to export all your data:

```python
python export_all_projects.py --all
```

This creates a `phoenix_export` folder with all your data.

### Step 4: Import Your Data to Arize AX

Run this command to import everything:

```python
python import_to_arize.py --all
```

<Warning>
The import process will guide you through setting up annotations. Follow the prompts carefully.

</Warning>

## Common Options

### Export Specific Projects Only

If you only want certain projects:

```python
python export_all_projects.py --all --project "my-important-project"
```

### Export Specific Data Types

If you only need certain types of data:

```python
# Just datasets and prompts
python export_all_projects.py --datasets --prompts

# Just traces
python export_all_projects.py --traces
```

### Get More Details

Add `--verbose` to see detailed progress:

```python
python export_all_projects.py --all --verbose
python import_to_arize.py --all --verbose
```

## What Gets Created

After export, you'll see this structure:

```python
phoenix_export/
├── datasets/          # Your datasets
├── prompts/           # Your prompt templates
└── projects/          # Your projects and traces
    ├── project-1/
    └── project-2/
```

After import, check the `results/` folder for detailed logs.

## Troubleshooting

### "Authentication failed"

* Double-check your API keys in the `.env` file

* Make sure your keys have the right permissions

### "Connection timeout"

* Check your internet connection

* Try exporting one project at a time for large datasets

### Import issues with annotations

* Run the annotation setup first: `python import_to_arize.py --annotations`

* Follow the setup guide in your Arize AX interface

* Then re-run the full import

### Getting more help

* Use `--verbose` for detailed logs

* Check the `results/` folder for error details

* Visit the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Dylancouzon/phoenix2ax) for issues

## Important Notes

### For Annotations

Annotations require special setup:

1. Run: `python import_to_arize.py --annotations`

2. Configure annotation types in Arize AX (follow the prompts)

3. Re-run the import after setup

### For Large Datasets

If you have lots of data:

* Export one project at a time

* Use `--verbose` to monitor progress

* Be patient - large imports can take time

### Data Safety

* Your original Phoenix data stays unchanged

* You can re-run commands safely (duplicates are skipped)

* All data transfers are encrypted

## Next Steps

After migration:

1. ✅ Check your data in Arize AX

2. ✅ Verify key projects and datasets

3. ✅ Test annotations and evaluations

4. ✅ Set up your team's access in Arize AX
