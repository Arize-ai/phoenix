title: "Access Control (RBAC)"
---

The role-based access control (RBAC) in Phoenix is based on the following user roles:

* `admin` - full control to the system, can administer users, system keys, etc.
* `member` - a developer that can add traces, experiments, datasets, etc.
* `viewer` - read-only access; cannot create, update, or delete most entities.

A user's role controls their access via the UI as well as through the APIs.
