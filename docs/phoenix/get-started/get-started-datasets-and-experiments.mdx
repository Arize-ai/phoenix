title: "Get Started: Datasets & Experiments"
---
Now that you have Phoenix up and running, one of the next steps you can take is creating a **Dataset** & Running **Experiments**.

* Datasets let you curate and organize examples to test your application systematically.
* Experiments let you compare different model versions or configurations on the same dataset to see which performs best.

## Datasets

<Steps>
  <Step title={<span className="step-title">Launch Phoenix</span>}>
    Before setting up your first dataset, make sure Phoenix is running. For more step by step instructions, check out this [Get Started guide](/phoenix/get-started).

    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="Phoenix Cloud">
        Log in, create a space, navigate to the settings page in your space, and create your API keys.

        Set your environment variables.

        ```bash
        export PHOENIX_API_KEY = "ADD YOUR PHOENIX API KEY"
        export PHOENIX_COLLECTOR_ENDPOINT = "ADD YOUR PHOENIX COLLECTOR ENDPOINT"
        ```

        You can find your collector endpoint here:

        <Frame caption="Launch your space, navigate to settings & copy your hostname for your collector endpoint">
          <img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/arize-phoenix-assets/assets/images/phoenix-docs-images/phoenix_hostname_settings.png" alt="After launching your space, go to settings." />
        </Frame>

        Your Collector Endpoint is: [https://app.phoenix.arize.com/s/](https://app.phoenix.arize.com/s/) + your space name.
      </Tab>

      <Tab title="Local (Self-hosted)">
        If you installed Phoenix locally, you have a variety of options for deployment methods including: Terminal, Docker, Kubernetes, Railway, & AWS CloudFormation. ([Learn more: Self-Hosting](https://arize.com/docs/phoenix/self-hosting))

        To host on your local machine, run `phoenix serve` in your terminal.

        Navigate to your localhost in your browser. (example localhost:6006)
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>
  </Step>

  <Step title={<span className="step-title">Creating a Dataset</span>}>
    You can either create a Dataset in the UI, or via code.

    For this quickstart, you can download this [sample.csv](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1n2WoejEe807VYGVT-GsTAA3QUdyFtR6g/view?usp=sharing) as a starter to run you through how to use datasets.

    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="UI">
        In the UI, you can either create a empty dataset and then populate data or upload from a CSV.

        Once you've downloaded the above csv file, you can follow the video below to upload your first dataset.

        <Frame>
          <iframe src="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1UOSnEbmcf-ELE85h4JcPpPiqx5LxgaGj/preview" allowFullScreen style={{ width: '100%', height: '420px' }} />
        </Frame>
      </Tab>

      <Tab title="Python">
        To create a Dataset in Phoenix, you will use the `datasets.create_dataset()` function. This can take in either a CSV file, Pandas DataFrame, or dataset Examples.

        If you have already downloaded the sample.csv, you can create this dataset via this code snippet:

        ```python
        from phoenix.client import AsyncClient

        px_client = AsyncClient()
        dataset = await px_client.datasets.create_dataset(
            csv_file_path="sample.csv",
            name="test-dataset",
            input_keys=["input"],
            output_keys=["output", "label"]
        )
        ```
      </Tab>

      <Tab title="TS">
        ```typescript
        import { createDataset } from "@arizeai/phoenix-client/datasets";

        // Data must be an array of Example objects with this structure:
        // {
        //   input: Record<string, unknown>,    // required
        //   output?: Record<string, unknown>,  // optional
        //   metadata?: Record<string, unknown> // optional
        // }
        // Parse sample.csv into this format

        const { datasetId } = await createDataset({
          name: "my-dataset",
          description: "My dataset description",
          examples: [
            {
              input: { question: "What is 2+2?" },
              output: { answer: "4" },
              metadata: { difficulty: "easy" },
            },
            {
              input: { question: "What is the capital of France?" },
              output: { answer: "Paris" },
            },
            // ... more examples
          ],
        });
        ```
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>

    That's it! You've now successfully created your first dataset.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Experiments

Once you have a dataset, you're now able to run experiments. Experiments are made of tasks &, optionally, evals. While running evals is optional, they provide valuable metrics to help you compare each of your experiments quickly — such as comparing models, catching regressions, and understanding which version performs best.

<Steps>
  <Step title={<span className="step-title">Load your Dataset in Code</span>}>
    The first step is to pull down your dataset into your code.

    If you made your dataset in the UI, you can follow this code snippet:

    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="Python">
        ```python
        from phoenix.client import AsyncClient

        client = AsyncClient()
        dataset = await client.datasets.get_dataset(dataset="sample", version_id={your version id here})
        ```

        To get the `version_id` of your dataset, please navigate to the Versions tab and copy the version you want to run an experiment on.
      </Tab>

      <Tab title="Typescript">
        ```typescript
        import { getDataset } from "@arizeai/phoenix-client/datasets";

        const dataset = await getDataset({
          dataset: {
            datasetName: "sample",
            versionId: "your-version-id-here",  // optional
          },
        });
        ```

        To get the `version_id` of your dataset, please navigate to the Versions tab and copy the version you want to run an experiment on.
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>

    If you created your dataset programmatically, you should already have it available as an instance assigned to your dataset variable.
  </Step>

  <Step title={<span className="step-title">Create your Task</span>}>
    Create a Task to evaluate.

    Your task can be any function with any definition & does not have to use an LLM. However, for our experiment we want to run our list of input questions through a new prompt.


    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="Python">
        ```python
        from phoenix.experiments.types import Example

        task_prompt_template = "Answer this question: {question}"

        def task(example: Example) -> str:
            question = example.input
            message_content = task_prompt_template.format(question=question)
            response = openai_client.chat.completions.create(
                model="gpt-4o", messages=[{"role": "user", "content": message_content}]
            )
            return response.choices[0].message.content
        ```
      </Tab>

      <Tab title="Typescript">
        ```typescript
        import { OpenAI } from "openai";
        import { type RunExperimentParams } from "@arizeai/phoenix-client/experiments";

        // Initialize OpenAI client
        const openai = new OpenAI({
          apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY
        });

        const taskPromptTemplate = "Answer this question: {question}";

        const task: RunExperimentParams["task"] = async (example) => {
          // Access question with type assertion
          const question = example.input.question || "No question provided";
          const messageContent = taskPromptTemplate.replace("{question}", question);

          const response = await openai.chat.completions.create({
            model: "gpt-4o", 
            messages: [{ role: "user", content: messageContent }]
          });

          return response.choices[0]?.message?.content || "";
        };
        ```
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>
  </Step>

  <Step title={<span className="step-title">Create your Evaluator</span>}>
    Next step is to create your Evaluator. If you have already defined your Q&A Correctness eval from the last quick start, you won't need to redefine it. If not, you can follow along with these code snippets.
