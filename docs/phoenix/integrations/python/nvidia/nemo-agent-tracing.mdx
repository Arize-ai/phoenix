Phoenix provides seamless observability and tracing for NVIDIA NeMo Agent Toolkit workflows. This guide walks you through setting up telemetry to view traces in the Phoenix UI.

## Install

Install the Phoenix subpackage to enable tracing capabilities:

```bash
uv pip install -e '.[phoenix]'
```

## Setup

### Step 1: Start the Phoenix Server

Run the following command to start Phoenix server locally:

```bash
phoenix serve
```

Phoenix should now be accessible at `http://0.0.0.0:6006`.

### Step 2: Configure Your Workflow

Update your workflow configuration file to include the telemetry settings. Add the following to your workflow configuration:

```yaml
general:
  telemetry:
    tracing:
      phoenix:
        _type: phoenix
        endpoint: http://localhost:6006/v1/traces
        project: my_workflow_project
```

This setup enables tracing through Phoenix at `http://localhost:6006/v1/traces`, with traces grouped into your specified project.

## Run Your Workflow

From the root directory of the NeMo Agent toolkit library, install dependencies and run your workflow:

```bash
# Install the workflow and plugins
uv pip install -e examples/observability/simple_calculator_observability/

# Run the workflow with Phoenix telemetry settings
nat run --config_file examples/observability/simple_calculator_observability/configs/config-phoenix.yml --input "What is 1*2?"
```

As the workflow runs, trace data will show up in Phoenix.

## Observe

Open your browser and navigate to `http://0.0.0.0:6006` to view your workflow traces:

* Locate your workflow traces under your project name in projects
* Inspect execution details (latency, tokens, etc.) and run evaluations on your traces
