## Pull Langflow Repo

Navigate to the Langflow GitHub repo and pull the project down

<Card horizontal icon="github" href="https://github.com/langflow-ai/langflow" title="Not found"/>

## Create .env file

Navigate to the repo and create a `.env` file with all the Arize Phoenix variables.

You can use the `.env.example` as a template to create the `.env` file

Add the following environment variable to the `.env` file

```python
# Arize Phoenix Env Variables
PHOENIX_API_KEY="YOUR_PHOENIX_KEY_HERE"
```

Note: This Langflow integration is for [Phoenix](https://app.phoenix.arize.com/login/sign-up)[Cloud](https://app.phoenix.arize.com/login/sign-up)

## Start Docker Desktop

Start Docker Desktop, build the images, and run the container (this will take around 10 minutes the first time) Go into your terminal into the Langflow directory and run the following commands

```bash highlight={1}
docker compose -f docker/dev.docker-compose.yml down || true
docker compose -f docker/dev.docker-compose.yml up --remove-orphans
```

## Go to Hosted Langflow UI

## Create a Flow

In this example, we'll use Simple Agent for this tutorial

Add your OpenAI Key to the Agent component in Langflow

Go into the Playground and run the Agent

## Go to Arize Phoenix

Navigate to your project name (should match the name of of your Langflow Agent name)

## Inspect Traces

AgentExecutor Trace is Arize Phoenix instrumentation to capture what's happening with the LangChain being ran during the Langflow components

The other UUID trace is the native Langflow tracing.
