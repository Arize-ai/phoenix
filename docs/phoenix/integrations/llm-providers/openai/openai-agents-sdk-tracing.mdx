## 1. Install

```bash
pip install openinference-instrumentation-openai-agents openai-agents
```

## 3. Set up Tracing

Add your OpenAI API key as an environment variable:

```javascript
export OPENAI_API_KEY=[your_key_here]
```

Use the register function to connect your application to Phoenix:

```python
from phoenix.otel import register

# configure the Phoenix tracer
tracer_provider = register(
  project_name="agents", # Default is 'default'
  auto_instrument=True # Auto-instrument your app based on installed dependencies
)
```

Run your `agents`code.

```python
from agents import Agent, Runner

agent = Agent(name="Assistant", instructions="You are a helpful assistant")
result = Runner.run_sync(agent, "Write a haiku about recursion in programming.")
print(result.final_output)
```

View your traces in Phoenix.
