description: Instrument LLM calls made using the Google Gen AI Python SDK
---

### Install

```bash
pip install openinference-instrumentation-google-genai google-genai
```

### Setup

Set the `GEMINI_API_KEY` environment variable. To use the Gen AI SDK with Vertex AI instead of the Developer API, refer to Google's [guide](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/sdks/overview) on setting the required environment variables.

```javascript
export GEMINI_API_KEY=[your_key_here]
```

Use the register function to connect your application to Phoenix.

```python
from phoenix.otel import register

# Configure the Phoenix tracer
tracer_provider = register(
  project_name="my-llm-app", # Default is 'default'
  auto_instrument=True # Auto-instrument your app based on installed OI dependencies
)
```

### Observe

Now that you have tracing setup, all Gen AI SDK requests will be streamed to Phoenix for observability and evaluation.

```python
import os
from google import genai

def send_message_multi_turn() -> tuple[str, str]:
    client = genai.Client(api_key=os.environ["GEMINI_API_KEY"])
    chat = client.chats.create(model="gemini-2.0-flash-001")
    response1 = chat.send_message("What is the capital of France?")
    response2 = chat.send_message("Why is the sky blue?")

    return response1.text or "", response2.text or ""
```

<Info>
This instrumentation will support tool calling soon. Refer to [this page](https://pypi.org/project/openinference-instrumentation-google-genai/#description) for the status.
