Server-side evaluators run entirely in the Phoenix UI — no local code or API key setup required. Add them to any dataset from your project's Evaluators tab and Phoenix runs them automatically on every new experiment run.

There are two types of pre-built server-side evaluators:

- **Code evaluators** are deterministic. They apply a rule or algorithm to your data and return a result without calling any model.
- **LLM evaluators** use a judge model via a managed prompt template. Phoenix handles model configuration and API access — you only need to configure the input column mappings.
