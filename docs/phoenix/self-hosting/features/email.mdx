Optionally, you can configure an SMTP server to send transactional emails. These are used for password resets, user invitations, and more.

* **PHOENIX\_SMTP\_HOSTNAME:** The SMTP hostname to use for sending password reset emails.

* **PHOENIX\_SMTP\_PORT:** The SMTP port. Defaults to `587`.

* **PHOENIX\_SMTP\_USERNAME:** The SMTP username.

* **PHOENIX\_SMTP\_PASSWORD:** The SMTP password.

* **PHOENIX\_SMTP\_MAIL\_FROM:** The `from` address in the emails. Defaults to `noreply@arize.com`.

* **PHOENIX\_SMTP\_VALIDATE\_CERTS:** Whether to validate the SMTP server's certificate. Defaults to `true`.

Example usage:

```javascript
export PHOENIX_SMTP_HOSTNAME="smtp.example.com"
export PHOENIX_SMTP_PORT=587
export PHOENIX_SMTP_USERNAME="phoenix-user"
export PHOENIX_SMTP_PASSWORD="yourpassword"
export PHOENIX_SMTP_MAIL_FROM="noreply@yourdomain.com"
export PHOENIX_SMTP_VALIDATE_CERTS=true
```

These settings are required for password reset flows when authentication is enabled in Phoenix.
