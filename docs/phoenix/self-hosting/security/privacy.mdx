description: Understanding privacy and telemetry in self-hosted Phoenix deployments

## Self-Hosted Privacy

**Phoenix, when self-hosted, is fully private.** No data from your traces, evaluations, datasets, or any other application data is ever sent to Arize or any third party. All of your data remains entirely within your own infrastructure.

This means you have complete control over:
- Where your data is stored
- Who has access to your data
- How long your data is retained
- Your compliance with data privacy regulations

## Telemetry

### What kind of telemetry does Phoenix collect?

By default, Phoenix does **not** collect any telemetry from self-hosted instances. However, in the future we may enable analytics tracking via environment variables for usage analytics in the web interface.

### Why might telemetry be enabled?

When enabled, telemetry helps us to:
- Understand how Phoenix is used and improve the most relevant features
- Track overall usage for internal and external (e.g., fundraising) reporting
- Identify and fix issues in the user interface

### What data is collected?

When telemetry is enabled, only basic web analytics are collected (e.g., page views, UI interactions). **None of your trace data, evaluation results, or any sensitive information is ever collected.** The telemetry is limited to understanding how users interact with the Phoenix web interface.

### How can I opt-out?

Telemetry is currently disabled. To ensure it never gets enabled, set the following environment variable:

```bash
PHOENIX_TELEMETRY_ENABLED=false
```

This will disable all analytics tracking in the Phoenix web interface, regardless of any other telemetry-related environment variable settings.

### Air-gapped deployments

If you are running Phoenix in an air-gapped environment, set `PHOENIX_ALLOW_EXTERNAL_RESOURCES=false`. This will:

- Automatically disable all telemetry
- Disable external Google Fonts (the UI will fall back to system fonts)

This prevents any external network requests from the Phoenix web interface, avoiding connection timeouts and UI loading delays in environments without internet access.
