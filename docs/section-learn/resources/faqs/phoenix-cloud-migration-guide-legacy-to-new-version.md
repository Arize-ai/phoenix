# Phoenix Cloud Migration Guide: Legacy to New Version

To move to the new Phoenix Cloud, simply [create a new Phoenix account](https://app.arize.com/auth/phoenix/login) with a different email address. From there, you can start using a new Phoenix instance immediately. Your existing projects in your old (legacy) account will remain intact and independent, ensuring a clean transition.&#x20;

Since most users don’t use Phoenix Cloud for data storage, this straightforward approach works seamlessly for migrating to the latest version.

If you need to migrate data from the legacy version to the latest version, [contact the Phoenix team](https://arize-ai.slack.com/join/shared_invite/zt-2w57bhem8-hq24MB6u7yE_ZF_ilOYSBw#/shared-invite/email).&#x20;

### How to know which version of Phoenix Cloud you are on?

The easiest way to determine which version of Phoenix Cloud you’re using is by checking the **URL in your browser**:

1. The **new Phoenix Cloud version** will have a hostname structure like: `app.arize.phoenix.com/s/[your-space-name]`
2. If your Phoenix Cloud URL does **not** include `/s/` followed by your space name, you are on the **legacy version**.
