# Braintrust Open Source Alternative? LLM Evaluation Platform Comparison

Braintrust is an evaluation platform that serves as an alternative to Arize Phoenix. Both platforms support core AI application needs, such as: evaluating AI applications, prompt management, tracing executions, and experimentation. However, there are a few major differences.

### Why is Arize Phoenix a popular open source alternative to Braintrust?

Braintrust is a proprietary LLM-observability platform that often hits road-blocks when AI engineers need open code, friction-free self-hosting, or things like agent tracing or online evaluation. Arize Phoenix is a fully open-source alternative that fills those gaps while remaining free to run anywhere.

### Key Differences

#### Complete Ownership vs. Vendor Lock-In

Phoenix:

* 100% open source&#x20;
* Free self-hosting forever - no feature gates, no restrictions
* Deploy with a single Docker container - truly "batteries included"
* Your data stays on your infrastructure from day one

Braintrust:

* Proprietary closed-source platform
* Self-hosting locked behind paid Enterprise tier (custom pricing)
* Free tier severely limited: 14-day retention, 5 users max, 1GB storage
* $249/month minimum for meaningful usage ($1.50 per 1,000 scores beyond limit)

#### Developer-First Experience

Phoenix:

* Framework agnostic - works with LangChain, LlamaIndex, DSPy, custom agents, anything
* Built on OpenTelemetry/OpenInference standard - no proprietary lock-in
* Auto-instrumentation that just works across ecosystems
* Deploy anywhere: Docker, Kubernetes, AWS, your laptop - your choice

Braintrust:

* Platform-dependent approach
* Requires learning their specific APIs and workflows
* Limited deployment flexibility on free/Pro tiers
* Forces you into their ecosystem and pricing model

#### Evaluation & Observability&#x20;

Phoenix:

* Unlimited evaluations - run as many as you need
* Pre-built evaluators: hallucination detection, toxicity, relevance, Q\&A correctness
* Custom evaluators with code or natural language
* Human annotation capabilities built-in
* Real-time tracing with full visibility into LLM applications

Braintrust:

* 10,000 scores on free tier ($1.50 per 1,000 additional)
* 50,000 scores on Pro ($249/month) - can get expensive fast
* Good evaluation features, but pay-per-use model creates cost anxiety
* Enterprise features locked behind custom pricing

#### Self-Hosting ‚Äî Ease & Cost&#x20;

Phoenix deploys with one Docker command and is free/unlimited to run on-prem or in the cloud. Braintrust‚Äôs self-hosting is reserved for paid enterprise plans and uses a hybrid model: the control plane (UI, metadata DB) stays in Braintrust‚Äôs cloud while you run API and storage services (Brainstore) yourself, plus extra infra wiring (note: you still pay seat / eval / retention fees, with the free tier capped at 1M spans, 10K scores, 14 days retention).

#### Instrumentation & Agent Tracing

Phoenix ships OpenInference‚Äîan OTel-compatible auto-instrumentation layer that captures every prompt, tool call and agent step with sub-second latency. Braintrust has 5 instrumentation options supported versus Arize Ax & Phoenix who have 50+ instrumentations.

Arize AX and Phoenix are the leaders in agent tracing solutions. Brainstrust does not trace agents today. Braintrust accepts OTel spans but has no auto-instrumentors or semantic conventions; most teams embed an SDK or proxy into their code, adding dev effort and potential latency.

#### Evaluation (Offline & Online)

Phoenix offers built-in and custom evaluators, ‚Äúgolden‚Äù datasets, and high-scale evaluation scoring (millions/day) with sampling, logs and failure debugging. Braintrust‚Äôs UI is great for prompt trials but lacks benchmarking on labeled data and has weaker online-eval debugging.

The Phoenix Evaluation library is tested against public datasets and is community supported. It is an open source tried and tested library, with millions of downloads. It has been running in production for over two years by tens of thousands of top enterprise organizations.&#x20;

#### Human-in-the-Loop

Phoenix and Arize AX include annotation queues that let reviewers label any trace or dataset and auto-recompute metrics. Braintrust lacks queues; ‚ÄúReview‚Äù mode is manual and disconnected from evals

#### Agent Evaluation&#x20;

Phoenix and AX have released extensive Agent evaluation including path evaluations, convergence evaluations and session level evaluations. The investment in research, material and technology spans over a year of work from the Arize team. Arize is the leading company thinking and working on Agent evaluation.&#x20;

#### Open Source vs. Proprietary

One of the most fundamental differences is Phoenix‚Äôs open-source nature versus Braintrust‚Äôs proprietary approach. Phoenix is fully open source, meaning teams can inspect the code, customize the platform, and self-host it on their own infrastructure without licensing fees. This openness provides transparency and control that many organizations value. In contrast, Braintrust is a closed-source platform, which limits users‚Äô ability to customize or extend it.&#x20;

Moreover, Phoenix is built on open standards like OpenTelemetry and OpenInference for trace instrumentation. From day one, Phoenix and Arize AX have embraced open standards and open standards, ensuring compatibility with a wide range of tools and preventing vendor lock-in. Braintrust relies on its own SDK/proxy approach for logging, and does not offer the same degree of open extensibility. Its proprietary design means that while it can be integrated into apps, it ties you into Braintrust‚Äôs way of operating (and can introduce an LLM proxy layer for logging that some teams see as a potential point of latency or risk).&#x20;

Teams that prioritize transparency, community-driven development, and long-term flexibility often prefer an open solution like Phoenix.

### How to Choose

* Prototype & iterate fast? ‚Üí Phoenix (open, free, unlimited instrumentation & evals).\

* Scale, governance, compliance? ‚Üí Arize AX (also free to start, petabyte storage, 99.9 % SLA, HIPAA, RBAC, AI-powered analytics).\
