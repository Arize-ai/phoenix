# Quickstart: Tracing

## Overview

Tracing is a powerful tool for understanding the behavior of your LLM application. Phoenix has best-in-class tracing, irregardless of what framework you use.

To get started with traces, you will first want to start a local Phoenix app.

In your Jupyter or Colab environment, run the following command to install.

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Using pip" %}
```sh
pip install arize-phoenix[evals]
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Using conda" %}
```sh
conda install -c conda-forge arize-phoenix[evals]
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

To get started, launch the phoenix app.

```python
import phoenix as px
session = px.launch_app()
```

The above launches a Phoenix server that acts as a trace collector for any LLM application running locally.

```markup
🌍 To view the Phoenix app in your browser, visit https://z8rwookkcle1-496ff2e9c6d22116-6060-colab.googleusercontent.com/
📺 To view the Phoenix app in a notebook, run `px.active_session().view()`
📖 For more information on how to use Phoenix, check out https://docs.arize.com/phoenix
```

The `launch_app` command will spit out a URL for you to view the Phoenix UI. You can access this url again at any time via the [session](../api/session.md).\
\
Now that phoenix is up and running, you can now run a [LlamaIndex](../tracing/how-to-tracing/instrumentation/auto-instrument-python/llamaindex.md) or [LangChain](../tracing/how-to-tracing/instrumentation/auto-instrument-python/langchain.md) application OR just run the OpenAI API and debug your application as the traces stream in.

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="LlamaIndex" %}
To use llama-index's one click,  you must install the small integration first:

```bash
pip install 'llama-index-callbacks-arize-phoenix>1.3.0'
```

```python
import os
import phoenix as px
from llama_index.core import (
    Settings,
    VectorStoreIndex,
    SimpleDirectoryReader,
    set_global_handler,
)
from llama_index.embeddings.openai import OpenAIEmbedding
from llama_index.llms.openai import OpenAI

os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY"

# To view traces in Phoenix, you will first have to start a Phoenix server. You can do this by running the following:
session = px.launch_app()


# Once you have started a Phoenix server, you can start your LlamaIndex application and configure it to send traces to Phoenix. To do this, you will have to add configure Phoenix as the global handler
set_global_handler("arize_phoenix")


# LlamaIndex application initialization may vary
# depending on your application
Settings.llm = OpenAI(model="gpt-4-turbo-preview")
Settings.embed_model = OpenAIEmbedding(model="text-embedding-ada-002")


# Load your data and create an index. Note you usually want to store your index in a persistent store like a database or the file system
documents = SimpleDirectoryReader("YOUR_DATA_DIRECTORY").load_data()
index = VectorStoreIndex.from_documents(documents)

query_engine = index.as_query_engine()

# Query your LlamaIndex application
query_engine.query("What is the meaning of life?")
query_engine.query("Why did the cow jump over the moon?")

# View the traces in the Phoenix UI
px.active_session().url
```

See the [LlamaIndex](../tracing/how-to-tracing/instrumentation/auto-instrument-python/llamaindex.md) for the full details as well as support for older versions of LlamaIndex
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="LangChain" %}
```python
from phoenix.trace.langchain import LangChainInstrumentor

LangChainInstrumentor().instrument()

# Initialize your LangChain application
# This might vary on your use-case. An example Chain is shown below
from langchain.chains import RetrievalQA
from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI
from langchain.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddings
from langchain.retrievers import KNNRetriever

embeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings(model="text-embedding-ada-002")

knn_retriever = KNNRetriever(
    index=vectors,
    texts=texts,
    embeddings=OpenAIEmbeddings(),
)

llm = ChatOpenAI(model_name="gpt-3.5-turbo")
chain = RetrievalQA.from_chain_type(
    llm=llm,
    chain_type="map_reduce",
    retriever=knn_retriever,
)

# Execute the chain
response = chain.run("What is OpenInference tracing?")
```

See the [integration guide](../tracing/how-to-tracing/instrumentation/auto-instrument-python/langchain.md#traces) for details
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="OpenAI" %}
```python
import os
from openai import OpenAI
from phoenix.trace.openai import OpenAIInstrumentor

# Initialize OpenAI auto-instrumentation
OpenAIInstrumentor().instrument()

# Initialize an OpenAI client
# note you must have the OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable set
client = OpenAI()

# Define a conversation with a user message
conversation = [
    {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."},
    {"role": "user", "content": "Hello, can you help me with something?"}
]

# Generate a response from the assistant
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-3.5-turbo",
    messages=conversation,
)

# Extract and print the assistant's reply
# The traces will be available in the Phoenix App for the above messsages
assistant_reply = response.choices[0].message.content
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="AutoGen" %}
```python
from phoenix.trace.openai.instrumentor import OpenAIInstrumentor
from phoenix.trace.openai import OpenAIInstrumentor

import phoenix as px
px.launch_app()
OpenAIInstrumentor().instrument()
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

Once you've executed a sufficient number of queries (or chats) to your application, you can view the details of the UI by refreshing the browser url

## Trace Datasets

Phoenix also support datasets that contain [OpenInference trace](../reference/open-inference.md) data. This allows data from a LangChain and LlamaIndex running instance explored for analysis offline.

There are two ways to extract trace dataframes. The two ways for LangChain are described below.

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="From the App" %}
<pre class="language-python"><code class="lang-python"><strong># You can export a dataframe from the session
</strong><strong># Note that you can apply a filter if you would like to export only a sub-set of spans
</strong><strong>df = px.Client().get_spans_dataframe('span_kind == "RETRIEVER"')
</strong>
<strong># Re-launch the app using the data
</strong>px.launch_app(trace=px.TraceDataset(df))
</code></pre>
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

{% hint style="info" %}
For full details on how to export trace data, see [the detailed guide](../how-to/export-your-data.md#exporting-traces)
{% endhint %}

## Evaluating Traces

In addition to launching phoenix on LlamaIndex and LangChain, teams can export trace data to a dataframe in order to run LLM Evals on the data.

{% hint style="info" %}
Learn more in the [evals quickstart](evals.md).
{% endhint %}

## Conclusion

[LLM Traces](../concepts/llm-traces.md) are a powerful way to troubleshoot and understand your application and can be leveraged to [evaluate](../llm-evals/llm-evals.md) the quality of your application. For a full list of notebooks that illustrate this in full-color, please check out the [notebooks section](../notebooks.md).
