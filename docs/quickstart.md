# Quickstart

[![Open in Colab](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?message=Open%20in%20Colab\&logo=googlecolab\&labelColor=grey\&color=blue\&logoColor=orange\&label=%20)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Arize-ai/phoenix/blob/main/tutorials/quickstart.ipynb) [![Open in GitHub](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?message=Open%20in%20GitHub\&logo=github\&labelColor=grey\&color=blue\&logoColor=white\&label=%20)](https://github.com/Arize-ai/phoenix/blob/main/tutorials/quickstart.ipynb)

In this quickstart, you will:

* Download curated datasets of embeddings and predictions and load them into a pandas DataFrame
* Define a schema to describe the format of your data
* Launch Phoenix and explore the app

Let's get started!

## Install Dependencies and Import Libraries

Install Phoenix and its dependencies in your notebook environment.

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Install from Terminal" %}
From your terminal, run

```
pip install arize-phoenix
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Install from Notebook Cell" %}
In a notebook cell, execute

```python
%pip install arize-phoenix
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

Import libraries for the quickstart.

```python
from dataclasses import replace
import phoenix as px
```

## Download the Data

Download the curated dataset.

```python
train_df = pd.read_parquet(
    "https://storage.googleapis.com/arize-assets/phoenix/datasets/unstructured/cv/human-actions/human_actions_training.parquet"
)
prod_df = pd.read_parquet(
    "https://storage.googleapis.com/arize-assets/phoenix/datasets/unstructured/cv/human-actions/human_actions_production.parquet"
)
```

## Launch Phoenix

### a) Define Your Schema

To launch Phoenix with your data, you first need to define a schema that tells Phoenix which columns of your DataFrames correspond to features, predictions, actuals (i.e., ground truth), embeddings, etc.

The trickiest part is defining embedding features. In this case, each embedding feature has two pieces of information: the embedding vector itself contained in the "image\_vector" column and the link to the image contained in the "url" column.

Define a schema for your training data.

```python
train_schema = px.Schema(
    timestamp_column_name="prediction_ts",
    prediction_label_column_name="predicted_action",
    actual_label_column_name="actual_action",
    embedding_feature_column_names={
        "image_embedding": px.EmbeddingColumnNames(
            vector_column_name="image_vector",
            link_to_data_column_name="url",
        ),
    },
)
```

The schema for your production data is the same, except it does not have an actual label column.

```python
prod_schema = replace(train_schema, actual_label_column_name=None)
```

### b) Define Your Datasets

Next, define your primary and reference datasets. In this case, your reference dataset contains training data and your primary dataset contains production data.

```python
prod_ds = px.Dataset(prod_df, prod_schema)
train_ds = px.Dataset(train_df, train_schema)
```

### c) Create a Phoenix Session

```python
session = px.launch_app(prod_ds, train_ds)
```

### d) Launch the Phoenix UI

Launch the Phoenix UI either within your notebook or in a separate browser tab or window.

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="In the Browser" %}
In a notebook cell, run

```python
session.url
```

Copy and paste the output URL into a new browser tab or window.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="In Your Notebook" %}
In a notebook cell, run

```python
session.view()
```

The Phoenix UI will appear in an inline frame in the cell output.
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

## Explore the App

Click on "image\_embedding" in the "Embeddings" section to visualize your embedding data. What insights can you uncover from this page?

## Close the App

When you're done, don't forget to close the app.

```python
px.close_app()
```

## Next Steps

Congrats! You've taken your first flight with Phoenix. We recommend that you next:

* Understand the [foundational concepts of the Phoenix API](concepts/phoenix-basics.md)
* Experiment with our end-to-end [example notebooks](tutorials/notebooks.md)
* Learn how to [use Phoenix with your own data](how-to/define-your-schema.md) and how to [manage the app](how-to/manage-the-app.md).
