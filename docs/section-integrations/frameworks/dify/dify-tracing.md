# Dify Tracing

## Launch Phoenix <a href="#launch-arize" id="launch-arize"></a>

The fastest way to get started with Phoenix is by signing up for a [free Phoenix Cloud account](https://app.arize.com/auth/phoenix/signup). If you prefer, you can also run Phoenix in a [notebook](https://app.gitbook.com/s/ShR775Rt7OzHRfy5j2Ks/environments#notebooks), [self-host it](https://app.gitbook.com/s/ShR775Rt7OzHRfy5j2Ks/environments#container), or use it directly from your [terminal](https://app.gitbook.com/s/ShR775Rt7OzHRfy5j2Ks/environments#terminal).

#### Get your API Key and Endpoint

Go to the settings page in your Phoenix instance to find your endpoint and API key.
