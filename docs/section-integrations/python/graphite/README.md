**Website:** [https://binome-dev.github.io/graphite/](https://binome-dev.github.io/graphite/)

Graphite combines a drag-and-drop workflow canvas with Python tooling so teams
can prototype, orchestrate, and monitor complex multi-agent applications. The
Phoenix integration streams Graphite's OpenTelemetry traces into Phoenix or
Arize for observability across development and production environments.
