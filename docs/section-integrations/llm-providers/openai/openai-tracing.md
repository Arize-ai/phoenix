# OpenAI Tracing

Phoenix provides auto-instrumentation for the [OpenAI Python Library](https://github.com/openai/openai-python).

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note**_:_ This instrumentation also works with Azure OpenAI
{% endhint %}

## Launch Phoenix

We have several code samples below on different ways to integrate with OpenAI, based on how you want to use Phoenix.

{% include "../../../../phoenix-integrations/.gitbook/includes/sign-up-for-phoenix-sign-up....md" %}

## Install

```bash
pip install openinference-instrumentation-openai openai
```

## Setup

Add your OpenAI API key as an environment variable:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=[your_key_here]
```

Use the register function to connect your application to Phoenix:

```python
from phoenix.otel import register

# configure the Phoenix tracer
tracer_provider = register(
  project_name="my-llm-app", # Default is 'default'
  auto_instrument=True # Auto-instrument your app based on installed dependencies
)
```

## Run OpenAI

```python
import openai

client = openai.OpenAI()
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-4o",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Write a haiku."}],
)
print(response.choices[0].message.content)
```

## Observe

Now that you have tracing setup, all invocations of OpenAI (completions, chat completions, embeddings) will be streamed to your running Phoenix for observability and evaluation.
