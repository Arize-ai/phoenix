This release introduces a REST API for managing projects, complete with full CRUD functionality and access control. Key features include:

* **CRUD Operations:** Create, read, update, and delete projects via the new API endpoints.
* **Role-Based Access Control:**
  * Admins can create, read, update, and delete projects
  * Members can create and read projects, but cannot modify or delete them.
* **Additional Safeguards:** Immutable Project Names, Default Project Protection, Comprehensive Integration Tests

Check out our [new documentation ](https://arize.com/docs/phoenix/sdk-api-reference/projects)to test these features.
