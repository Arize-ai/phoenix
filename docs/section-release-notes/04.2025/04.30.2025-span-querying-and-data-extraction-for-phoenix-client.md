# 04.30.2025:  Span Querying & Data Extraction for Phoenix Client üìä

{% embed url="https://storage.googleapis.com/arize-phoenix-assets/assets/gifs/spans_df.gif" %}

The Phoenix client now includes the **`SpanQuery` DSL**, enabling more advanced and flexible span querying for distributed tracing and telemetry data. This allows users to perform complex queries on span data, improving trace analysis and debugging.

&#x20;In addition, the **`get_spans_dataframe`** method has been migrated, offering an easy-to-use way to extract span-related information as a Pandas DataFrame. This simplifies data processing and visualization, making it easier to analyze trace data within Python-based environments.
