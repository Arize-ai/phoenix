# 04.15.2025: Display Tool Call and Result IDs in Span Details 🫆

{% embed url="https://storage.googleapis.com/arize-phoenix-assets/assets/gifs/tool_calling_ids2.gif" %}

Tool call and result IDs are now shown in the span details view. Each ID is placed within a collapsible header and can be easily copied. This update also supports spans with multiple tool calls. Get started with tracing your tool calls [here](https://arize.com/docs/phoenix/tracing/llm-traces-1).

### Improvements and Bug Fixes 🐛
