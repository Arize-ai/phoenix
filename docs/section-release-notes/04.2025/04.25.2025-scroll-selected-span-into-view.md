# 04.25.2025: Scroll Selected Span Into View üñ±Ô∏è

{% embed url="https://storage.googleapis.com/arize-phoenix-assets/assets/gifs/span_scroll.gif" %}

Improved trace navigation by automatically scrolling the selected span into view when a user navigates to a specific trace. This enhancement eliminates the need for manual searching or scrolling, allowing users to immediately focus on the span of interest. It's especially useful when navigating from links or alerts that point to a specific span, improving debugging efficiency. This change contributes to a smoother and more intuitive trace exploration experience.
