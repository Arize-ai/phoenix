We've added Authentication and Rules-based Access Controls to Phoenix. This was a long-requested feature set, and we're excited for the new uses of Phoenix this will unlock!

The auth feature set includes:

* **Secure Access**: All of Phoenix‚Äôs UI & APIs (REST, GraphQL, gRPC) now require access tokens or API keys. Keep your data safe!
* **RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)**: Admins can manage users; members can update their profiles‚Äîsimple & secure.
* **API Keys**: Now available for seamless, secure data ingestion & querying.
* **OAuth2 Support**: Easily integrate with Google, AWS Cognito, or Auth0. ‚úâ Password Resets via SMTP to make security a breeze.

For all the details on authentication, view our [docs](https://arize.com/docs/phoenix/deployment/authentication).
