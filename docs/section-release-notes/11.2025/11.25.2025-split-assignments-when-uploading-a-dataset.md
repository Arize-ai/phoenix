# 11.25.2025: Split Assignments When Uploading a Dataset 🗂️

{% embed url="https://storage.googleapis.com/arize-phoenix-assets/assets/images/upload-dataset-splits.mp4" %}

With this update, Phoenix supports providing split labels during dataset upload — so you don’t have to assign splits manually after uploading.&#x20;

Once uploaded, you can immediately filter, query, or use those splits in experiments and evaluations. This streamlines data-preparation workflows and removes an extra manual step when organizing datasets for training, evaluation, or analysis.
