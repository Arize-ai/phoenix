# 11.27.2025: Show Server Credential Setup in Playground API Keys 🔐

{% embed url="https://storage.googleapis.com/arize-phoenix-assets/assets/images/playground-server-credential-set-up.png" %}

With this update, the UI in Arize Phoenix’s Playground settings will display whether server-side credentials are set up — giving you clear visibility into credential configuration.&#x20;

This makes it easier to confirm that your API keys or server credentials are properly configured before running prompts, reducing setup confusion and avoiding failed requests due to missing credentials.
