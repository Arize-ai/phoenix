* Added **easy manual instrumentation** with the same decorators, wrappers, and attribute helpers found in the Python `openinference-instrumentation` package.
* Introduced **function tracing utilities** that automatically create spans for sync/async function execution, including specialized wrappers for **chains**, **agents**, and **tools**.
* Added **decorator-based method tracing**, enabling automatic span creation on class methods via the `@observe` decorator.
* Expanded **attribute helper utilities** for standardized OpenTelemetry metadata creation, including helpers for **inputs/outputs**, **LLM operations**, **embeddings**, **retrievers**, and **tool definitions**.
* Overall, tracing workflows, agent behavior, and external tool calls is now significantly simpler and more consistent across languages.
