# 04.28.2025: TLS Support for Phoenix Server üîê

Phoenix now supports Transport Layer Security (TLS) for both HTTP and gRPC connections, enabling encrypted communication and optional mutual TLS (mTLS) authentication. This enhancement provides a more secure foundation for production deployments.

### **Highlights:**

* **Secure HTTP & gRPC Connections:** Phoenix can now serve over HTTPS and secure gRPC.
* **Flexible TLS Configuration:** TLS settings are managed via environment variables.
* **Optional Client Verification:** Support for mTLS with configurable client certificate validation.
* **Improved Testing:** TLS-aware infrastructure added to integration tests.
* **Better Visibility:** Server startup logs now display TLS status.

### **Configuration Options**

Set the following environment variables to enable and customize TLS:

| Variable                        | Type    | Description                                      |
| ------------------------------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `PHOENIX_TLS_ENABLED`           | boolean | Enable or disable TLS (`true`/`false`)           |
| `PHOENIX_TLS_CERT_FILE`         | string  | Path to TLS certificate file                     |
| `PHOENIX_TLS_KEY_FILE`          | string  | Path to private key file                         |
| `PHOENIX_TLS_KEY_FILE_PASSWORD` | string  | Password for encrypted private key file          |
| `PHOENIX_TLS_CA_FILE`           | string  | Path to CA certificate (for client verification) |
| `PHOENIX_TLS_VERIFY_CLIENT`     | boolean | Enable client cert verification                  |

**Note:** Encrypted private keys require the `cryptography` Python package for decryption.
