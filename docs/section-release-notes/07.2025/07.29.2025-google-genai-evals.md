{% embed url="https://storage.googleapis.com/arize-phoenix-assets/assets/images/gemini_logo.png" %}

We‚Äôve added support for the `GoogleGenAIModel` in **`phoenix-evals`**, enabling direct access to Google's Gemini models through the official Google GenAI SDK. As of late 2024, this is the recommended approach for working with Gemini, offering a unified interface across both the Developer API and VertexAI.

**üöÄ Key Features**

* **Multimodal Support**\
  Run evaluations on **text**, **image**, and **audio** inputs using Gemini‚Äôs multimodal capabilities.
* **Async-Ready**\
  Optimized for **high-throughput evals** with full **async** compatibility.
* **Flexible Authentication**\
  Supports both **API key** and **VertexAI-based** authentication methods.
* **Dynamic Rate Limiting**\
  Built-in **rate limiter** with automatic adjustment based on API feedback and usage patterns.

This integration makes it easier to run robust, scalable evaluations using Gemini models directly within your `phoenix-evals` workflows.
