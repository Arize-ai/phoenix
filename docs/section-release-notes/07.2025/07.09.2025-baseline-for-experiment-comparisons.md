# 07.09.2025: Baseline for Experiment Comparisons üîÅ

You can now set a **baseline run** when comparing multiple experiments. This is especially useful when one run represents a known-good output (e.g. a previous model version or a CI-approved run), and you want to evaluate changes relative to it.

For example, in an evaluation like `accuracy`, you can easily see where the value flipped from `correct ‚Üí incorrect` or `incorrect ‚Üí correct` between your baseline and the current comparison - helping you quickly spot regressions or improvements.

This feature makes it easier to isolate the impact of changes like a new prompt, model, or dataset.
