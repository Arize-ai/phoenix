**New Features:**

* Sends **warning emails** to administrators when usage crosses a configured threshold.
* **Blocks insert/update operations** when usage exceeds a higher critical threshold.
* Introduced **configurable environment variables** for warning and blocking thresholds with validation.
* Integrated disk usage checks into both the **FastAPI app** and **gRPC serve** to enforce write blocked.

**Enhancements:**

* Extended the email sender with a method and HTML template specifically for **disk usage alert notifications**.
