# 07.13.2025: Experiments Module in phoenix-client ðŸ§ª

{% embed url="https://pypi.org/project/arize-phoenix-client/" %}

**New Features in Phoenix 11.7+:**

* Added a new `experiments` property to both `Client` and `AsyncClient` for invoking experiment workflows.
* Introduced `Experiments` and `AsyncExperiments` classes with `run_experiment` methods supporting **tasks, evaluators, dry-run mode**, and **metadata**.
* Implemented `SyncExecutor` and `AsyncExecutor` classes for **concurrent execution** with built-in **progress bars**.
* Added `RateLimiter` and `AdaptiveTokenBucket` for intelligent handling and throttling of **rate-limit errors**.

**Bug Fixes:**

* Fixed a typo in the `datasets.get_dataset_versions` docstring.

**Enhancements:**

* Introduced a `PhoenixException` base class and **refactored exception imports** for consistency.
* Simplified rate limiter output by replacing `printif` with direct print statements.
