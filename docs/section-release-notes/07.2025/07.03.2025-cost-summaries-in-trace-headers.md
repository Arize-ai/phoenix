# 07.03.2025: Cost Summaries in Trace Headers ðŸ’¸

{% embed url="https://storage.googleapis.com/arize-phoenix-assets/assets/images/cost-summary-trace.png" %}

You can now **see total and segmented costs directly in your Phoenix trace headers** for faster debugging and spend visibility.

#### New Features:

* Extended `TraceDetails` GraphQL query to include `costSummary` fields (prompt, completion, total).
* Passes `costSummary` data into `TraceHeader` and displays formatted total cost.
* Adds a tooltip in `TraceHeader` showing **prompt vs. completion cost breakdown**.
