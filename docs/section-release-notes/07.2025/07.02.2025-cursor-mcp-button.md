### **Cursor IDE Integration**

You can now click “Add to Cursor” directly in the [Phoenix README ](https://github.com/Arize-ai/phoenix)to get a continuously updating MCP server configuration integrated into your IDE. This makes it seamless to keep your Phoenix + MCP setup in sync while developing with Cursor.

### **New `phoenix-support` Tool for Agents**

The `phoenix-support` tool from `@arizeai/phoenix-mcp@2.2.0` allows Agents like Cursor, Claude, and Windsurf to:

* Look up **Phoenix and OpenInference documentation** and best practices.
* Use this information to **make code changes automatically** in your workspace.
* For Example: Watch Cursor 1-shot instrument a LlamaIndex app using Phoenix without manual intervention.
