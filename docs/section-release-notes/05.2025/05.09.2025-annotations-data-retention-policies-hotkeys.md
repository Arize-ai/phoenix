Annotation Improvements
{% endembed %}

Phoenix v9.0.0 release brings major updates to annotation support, and a whole host of other improvements.

## [Annotations](https://arize.com/docs/phoenix/tracing/features-tracing/how-to-annotate-traces) üè∑Ô∏è

Up until now, Phoenix has only supported one annotation of a given type on each trace. We've now unlocked that limit, allowing you to capture multiple values of an annotation label on each span.

In addition, we've added:

* API support for annotations - create, query, and update annotations through the REST API
* Additional support for code evaluations as annotations
* Support for arbitrary metadata on annotations
* Annotation configurations to structure your annotations within and across projects

## [Data Retention](https://app.gitbook.com/s/ShR775Rt7OzHRfy5j2Ks/settings/data-retention) üíø

Now you can create custom global and per-project data retention polices to remove traces after a certain window of time, or based on number of traces. Additionally, you can now view your disk usage in the Settings page of Phoenix.

## Hotkeys üî•

We've added hotkeys to Phoenix!

You can now use `j` and `k` to quickly page through your traces, and `e` and `n` to add annotations and notes - you never have to lift your hands off the keyboard again!
