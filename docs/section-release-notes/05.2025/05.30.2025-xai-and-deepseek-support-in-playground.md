# 05.30.2025: xAI and Deepseek Support in Playground üõù

Phoenix v10.5.0 now supports Deepseek and xAI models in Playground natively. Previous versions of Phoenix supported these as custom model endpoints, but that process has now been streamlined to offer these model providers from the main Playground dropdown.
