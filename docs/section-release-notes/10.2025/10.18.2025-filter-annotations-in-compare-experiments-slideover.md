# 10.18.2025: Filter Annotations in Compare Experiments Slideover ✍️

{% embed url="https://storage.googleapis.com/arize-phoenix-assets/assets/images/filter-annotation-compare-experiments.png" %}

Added filtering of annotations in the experiment compare slideover so that only annotations present on the selected experiment runs are displayed. This ensures a cleaner UI and avoids filters for annotations that don’t appear in the comparison set.
