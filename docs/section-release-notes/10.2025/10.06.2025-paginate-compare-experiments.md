# 10.06.2025: Paginate Compare Experiments ðŸ“ƒ

{% embed url="https://storage.googleapis.com/arize-phoenix-assets/assets/images/compare-experiment-paginate.png" %}

We added pagination to the **experiment comparison slideover** on the list page for smoother navigation through results. We also introduced a new **repetition number column**, visible only when the base experiment includes multiple repetitions.
