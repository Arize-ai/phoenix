# 10.26.2025: Add Split Edit Menu to Examples ䷖

{% embed url="https://storage.googleapis.com/arize-phoenix-assets/assets/images/add-splits-to-example.png" %}

Added a new **“Split”** dropdown to single-example view on the dataset pages, allowing users to update the data split classification (e.g., train/validation/test) directly from the example level.&#x20;

This improvement makes it easier to correct or adjust split assignments dynamically.&#x20;
