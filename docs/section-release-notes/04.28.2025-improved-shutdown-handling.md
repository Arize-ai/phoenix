# 04.28.2025: Improved Shutdown Handling üõë

When stopping the Phoenix server via `Ctrl+C`, the shutdown process now exits cleanly without displaying a traceback or returning a non-zero exit code. Previously, a `KeyboardInterrupt` and `CancelledError` traceback could appear, ending the process with status code 130. The server now swallows the interrupt for a smoother shutdown experience, exiting with code 0 by default to reflect intentional termination.
