**Datasets**: Datasets are a new core feature in Phoenix that live alongside your projects. They can be imported, exported, created, curated, manipulated, and viewed within the platform, and make fine-turning and experimentation easier.n

For more details on using datasets see our [documentation](https://arize.com/docs/phoenix/datasets-and-experiments/overview-datasets?utm_campaign=Phoenix%20Newsletter\&utm_source=hs_email\&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9Tx_lYbuasbD3Mzdwl0VNPcvy_YcbPudxu1qwBZ3T7Mh---A4PO-OJfhas-RR4Ys_IEb0F) or [example notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1e4vZR5VPelXXYGtWfvM3CErPhItHAIp2?usp=sharing\&utm_campaign=Phoenix%20Newsletter\&utm_source=hs_email\&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9Tx_lYbuasbD3Mzdwl0VNPcvy_YcbPudxu1qwBZ3T7Mh---A4PO-OJfhas-RR4Ys_IEb0F).

**Experiments:** Our new Datasets and Experiments feature enables you to create and manage datasets for rigorous testing and evaluation of your models. Check out our full [walkthrough](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rzxN-YV_DbE\&t=25s).

## [07.02.2024: Function Call Evaluations ‚öíÔ∏è](2024/07.02.2024-function-call-evaluations.md)

**Available in Phoenix 4.6+**

We are introducing a new built-in function call evaluator that scores the function/tool-calling capabilities of your LLMs. This off-the-shelf evaluator will help you ensure that your models are not just generating text but also effectively interacting with tools and functions as intended. Check out a [full walkthrough of the evaluator](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rsu-UZ1ZVZU).
