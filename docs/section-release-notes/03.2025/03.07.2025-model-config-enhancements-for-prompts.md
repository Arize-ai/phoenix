{% embed url="https://storage.googleapis.com/arize-phoenix-assets/assets/gifs/thinking_budget.gif" %}

* Save and Load from Prompts: You can now save and load configurations directly from prompts.
* Save and Load from Default Model Config: Default model configurations can be saved and loaded.
* Budget Token Management: Added the ability to adjust the budget token value.
* Thinking Configuration Toggle: You can now enable or disable the ‚Äúthinking‚Äù feature.

**Important Note:** The default model config does not automatically apply to saved prompts. To include default thinking settings, ensure they are saved within the specific prompt.
