We‚Äôve introduced several enhancements to **Projects**, providing greater flexibility and control over how you interact with data. These updates include:

* [**Persistent Column Selection on Tables**](https://github.com/Arize-ai/phoenix/issues/6572): Your selected columns will now remain consistent across sessions, ensuring a more seamless workflow.
* [**Metadata Filters from the Table**](https://github.com/Arize-ai/phoenix/releases/tag/arize-phoenix-v8.8.0)**:** Easily filter data directly from the table view using metadata attributes.
* **Custom Time Ranges:** You can now specify custom time ranges to filter traces and spans.
* **Root Span Filter for Spans:** Improved filtering options allow you to filter by root spans, helping to isolate and debug issues more effectively.
* [**Metadata Quick Filters**](https://github.com/Arize-ai/phoenix/releases/tag/arize-phoenix-v8.8.0)**:** Quickly apply common metadata filters for faster navigation.
* [**Performance**](https://github.com/Arize-ai/phoenix/releases/tag/arize-phoenix-v8.6.1): Major speed improvements in project tracing views & visibility into database usage in settings
