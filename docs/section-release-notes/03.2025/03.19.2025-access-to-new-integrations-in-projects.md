In the New Project tab, we've added quick setup to instrument your application for [**BeeAI**](https://arize.com/docs/phoenix/integrations/frameworks/beeai), [**SmolAgents**](https://arize.com/docs/phoenix/integrations/frameworks/hugging-face-smolagents), and the [**OpenAI Agents SDK**](https://arize.com/docs/phoenix/integrations/llm-providers/openai/openai-agents-sdk-tracing).&#x20;

Easily configure all integrations with streamlined instructions. Check out all Phoenix [tracing integrations](https://arize.com/docs/phoenix/integrations) here.
