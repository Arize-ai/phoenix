We've introduced the **OpenAI Agents SDK** for Python which provides enhanced visibility into agent behavior and performance.

**Installation**

```
pip install openinference-instrumentation-openai-agents openai-agents
```

* Includes an OpenTelemetry Instrumentor that traces agents, LLM calls, tool usage, and handoffs.
* With minimal setup, use the `register` function to connect your app to Phoenix and view real-time traces of agent workflows.

For more details on a quick setup, check out our integration documentation:
