# 09.08.2025: Experiment Annotation Popover in Detail View 🔍

{% embed url="https://storage.googleapis.com/arize-phoenix-assets/assets/images/annotation-popover-releasenotes.png" %}

We’ve added a new annotation popover feature on the experiment detail view: now when you click an annotation in the details panel, its full content is revealed in a popover. This makes it easier to view annotation details without navigating away.
