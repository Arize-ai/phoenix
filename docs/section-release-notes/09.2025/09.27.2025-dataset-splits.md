# 09.27.2025: Dataset Splits ðŸ“Š

Phoenix now supports **custom dataset splits**, allowing users to categorize examples into groups like _train_, _validation_, or _test_. This feature is essential for judge building, structured experimentation, and broader data science workflows. It provides more flexibility in organizing datasets and improves analysis across subsets of data.
