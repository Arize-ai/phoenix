# 09.24.2025: Custom HTTP headers for requests in Playground üõ†Ô∏è

{% embed url="https://storage.googleapis.com/arize-phoenix-assets/assets/images/custom-headers-playground.png" %}

This feature allows users to add custom HTTP headers to playground requests, enabling injection of provider-specific metadata (e.g. request IDs) via a JSON editor in the model config panel. The change extends the `GenerativeModelInput` schema to include `customHeaders`, with validation, per-provider storage, and conditional support.&#x20;
