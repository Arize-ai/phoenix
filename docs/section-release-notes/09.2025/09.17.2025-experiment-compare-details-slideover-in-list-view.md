{% embed url="https://storage.googleapis.com/arize-phoenix-assets/assets/images/release-notes-experiment-slideover.mp4" %}

This update introduces a slideover panel in the experiments list view that surfaces the experiment compare details directly without leaving the list. It lets users open detailed context inline and see comparison info side by side with the list.&#x20;
