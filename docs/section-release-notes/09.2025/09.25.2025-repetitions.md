Since LLMs are probabilistic, their synthesis can differ even when the supplied prompts are exactly the same. This can make it challenging to determine if a particular change is warranted as a single execution cannot concretely tell you whether a given change improves or degrades your task.\
So what can you do when an execution can change from one run to the next? That's where repetitions come in.&#x20;

Repetitions help you reduce uncertainty in systems prone to variability, notably more "agentic" systems.
