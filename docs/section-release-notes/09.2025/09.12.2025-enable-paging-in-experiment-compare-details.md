Weâ€™ve added paging functionality to the Experiment Compare details slide-over view, allowing users to navigate between individual examples using arrow buttons or keyboard shortcuts (`J` / `K`). Pagination is disabled at the first and last examples to avoid invalid navigation.&#x20;

Additional tweaks ensure smooth UX: the next page of examples is fetched automatically when the last slide-over example is reached.
