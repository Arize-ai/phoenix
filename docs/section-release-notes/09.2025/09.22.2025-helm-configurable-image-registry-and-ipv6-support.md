# 09.22.2025: Helm configurable image registry & IPv6 support 🌐

These updates enhance the Helm chart’s flexibility and compatibility. The image registry can now be customized (so you can point to private or alternative registries). In addition, full IPv6 support has been added, allowing deployments natively in IPv6 clusters. Together these changes help Phoenix run more reliably in diverse infrastructure environments.
