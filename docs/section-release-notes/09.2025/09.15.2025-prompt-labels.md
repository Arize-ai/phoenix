We‚Äôve added support for labeling prompts so you can categorize them by use-case, provider, or any custom tag. Now prompts can have labels assigned through a settings page, and you‚Äôll see those labels in the prompt table UI. This makes browsing, filtering, and managing large sets of prompts much easier.

Prompt labels are also shown in prompt details.&#x20;
