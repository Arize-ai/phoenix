# 09.03.2025: Add Methods to Log Document Annotations ðŸ“œ

We added new client-side support so that developers can log document annotations via the Phoenix platform: you can now use both synchronous and asynchronous API calls for this purpose. In particular, we introduced a new method, `log_document_annotations(...)`, on the Annotations resource. This method accepts `SpanDocumentAnnotationData` objects.
