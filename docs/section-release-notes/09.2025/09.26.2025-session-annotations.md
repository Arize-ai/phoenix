# 09.26.2025: Session AnnotationsüóÇÔ∏è

{% embed url="https://storage.googleapis.com/arize-phoenix-assets/assets/images/session-annotation.png" %}

With this change, annotation columns are added directly to the sessions table, making it possible to see session-level annotations in list views. Users no longer need to drill down into individual sessions to spot annotations. This gives better visibility and quicker context when browsing sessions in bulk.
