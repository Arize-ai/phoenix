{% embed url="https://storage.googleapis.com/arize-phoenix-assets/assets/images/sessions_rn.png" %}

Sessions allow you to group multiple responses into a single thread. Each response is still captured as a single trace, but each trace is linked together and presented in a combined view.

Sessions make it easier to visual multi-turn exchanges with your chatbot or agent Sessions launches with Python and TS/JS support. For more on sessions, check out[ a walkthrough video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzS6x0BE-EU) and the [docs](https://arize.com/docs/phoenix/tracing/how-to-tracing/setup-sessions?utm_campaign=Phoenix%20Newsletter\&utm_source=hs_email\&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--aSHse9NA8I5ncZzavHCp6LBXibZCgbWcRrxbh2RwugL6IQdTOSu8cz-Wqh6EO9xJLGX2E).
