# 07.02.2024: Function Call Evaluations ⚒️

{% embed url="https://storage.googleapis.com/arize-phoenix-assets/assets/gifs/evals-docs.gif" %}

We are introducing a new built-in function call evaluator that scores the function/tool-calling capabilities of your LLMs. This off-the-shelf evaluator will help you ensure that your models are not just generating text but also effectively interacting with tools and functions as intended.

This evaluator checks for issues arising from function routing, parameter extraction, and function generation.

Check out a [full walkthrough of the evaluator](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rsu-UZ1ZVZU).
