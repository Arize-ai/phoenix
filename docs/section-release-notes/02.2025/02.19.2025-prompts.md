Phoenix prompt management will now let you create, modify, tag, and version control prompts for your applications. Some key highlights from this release:

* **Versioning & Iteration**: Seamlessly manage prompt versions in both Phoenix and your codebase.
* **New TypeScript Clien**t: Sync prompts with your JavaScript runtime, now with native support for OpenAI, Anthropic, and the Vercel AI SDK.
* **New Python Clien**t: Sync templates and apply them to AI SDKs like OpenAI, Anthropic, and more.
* **Standardized Prompt Handling**: Native normalization for OpenAI, Anthropic, Azure OpenAI, and Google AI Studio.
* **Enhanced Metadata Propagation**: Track prompt metadata on Playground spans and experiment metadata in dataset runs.
