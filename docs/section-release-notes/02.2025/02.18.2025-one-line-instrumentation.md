# 02.18.2025: One-Line Instrumentation⚡️

{% embed url="https://storage.googleapis.com/arize-phoenix-assets/assets/images/trace_details_view.png" %}

Phoenix has made it even simpler to get started with tracing by introducing one-line auto-instrumentation. By using `register(auto_instrument=True)`, you can enable automatic instrumentation in your application, which will set up instrumentors based on your installed packages.

```
from phoenix.otel import register

register(auto_instrument=True)
```

For more details, you can check the docs and explore further [tracing](https://app.gitbook.com/s/ShR775Rt7OzHRfy5j2Ks/tracing/how-to-tracing/setup-tracing) options.
