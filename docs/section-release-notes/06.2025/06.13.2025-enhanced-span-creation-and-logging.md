# 06.13.2025: Enhanced Span Creation and Logging ü™ê

**New Features:**

* Added `POST /projects/{project_identifier}/spans` route for span ingestion.
* Added `log_spans` client method to submit a sequence of spans, rejecting the entire batch if any span is invalid or not unique.
* Added `log_spans_dataframe` for submitting spans as a dataframe.
* Introduced `uniquify_spans` and `uniquify_spans_dataframe` helpers to regenerate span and trace IDs while preserving relationships.
* Improved validation and error handling to prevent partial ingestion and ensure safe, conflict-free span creation.

#### Example Usage

```python
from phoenix.client import Client
from phoenix.client.helpers.spans import uniquify_spans

client = Client()

spans = [
    {
        "name": "llm_call",
        "context": {"trace_id": "trace_123", "span_id": "span_456"},
        "start_time": "2024-01-15T10:00:00Z",
        "end_time": "2024-01-15T10:00:05Z",
        "span_kind": "LLM"
    }
]

unique_spans = uniquify_spans(spans)
result = client.spans.log_spans(
    project_identifier="my-project",
    spans=unique_spans,
)
```
