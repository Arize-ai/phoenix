New visualizations Phoenix provide deeper insights into experiment performance over time.

With Experiment Progress Charts, you can now:

* Visualize how evaluation scores evolve across experiment runs
* Monitor evaluator performance and detect regressions
* Analyze latency trends to identify bottlenecks and inefficiencies

These collapsible visual tools eliminate the need for manual inspection and make it significantly easier to track the impact of changes in your LLM or agent workflows.
