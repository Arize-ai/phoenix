{% embed url="https://storage.googleapis.com/arize-phoenix-assets/assets/videos/genai.mp4" %}

Weâ€™ve added a Python auto-instrumentation library for the Google GenAI SDK. This enables seamless tracing of GenAI workflows with full OpenTelemetry compatibility. Traces can be exported to any OpenTelemetry collector.

### Installation

```bash
pip install openinference-instrumentation-google-genai
```

For more details on how to set up the tracing integration seamlessly:

Additionally, the Google GenAI instrumentor is now supported and works seamlessly with **Span Replay** in Phoenix, enabling deep trace inspection and replay for more effective debugging and observability.
