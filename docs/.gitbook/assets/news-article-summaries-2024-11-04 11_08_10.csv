RGF0YXNldEV4YW1wbGU6MTU5NQ==,"Boy, would Tiger like to find a fairway here,’ said former professional David Feherty. ‘Preferably one attached to this hole.’ It was that sort of day. Tiger Woods had worked so hard on his short game, the other quality needed to take a safe passage through these parts had been forgotten. He chipped like a champion; he drove like a boy racer. Somewhere in the ether, golf’s gods pointed and mocked. So Tiger’s short game is killing him? Opposite. There has been so much yip yap these last few weeks it was forgotten that Woods was becoming more erratic off the tee, long before his chipping went west. From the first, when he drifted into a bunker on the right, to the final par five, when he fired one into the crowd, castigating himself as a ‘dumbass’ — although a shout of ‘fore’ might have been more helpful — Woods took the long road around Augusta. The galleries were packed as crowd favourite Tiger Woods struggled on his first round at Augusta . Woods reacts to a poor chip shot on the third hole as the pressure begins to tell . Woods feels the heat at Augusta with the world No 111 struggling to get under par during the opening round . That he recorded a relatively respectable score — some significant distance off the lead, but certainly in the ball park of what would have been considered a reasonable number given that this was his first competitive golf for two months — was testament to his cussedness as much as his talent. Tiger dug deep and his play around the greens saved him. It was remarkable, really, considering his crisis of confidence. On the sixth, a par three, Woods missed the green again. He looked more than irritated, he looked worn down, fed up with a sport he once held on a string. He no doubt remembers how it used to be, too. How he must miss that old Tiger. He walked to the ball, perched at the top of a small incline to the right of the green. And he putted it. Rolled it down the slope, got it near enough. Settled. But, even so, it was a tell. The best poker players don’t have tells and Tiger likes Las Vegas as much as any high roller. But he saw his hand and, on that occasion, he blinked. It was still a Tiger gallery, of course. Still the biggest, still primed to applaud even the tiniest glimmer of his genius. But they would have recognised this as Tiger bluffing. Rewind through a decade and he would have conjured something small and miraculous with a short iron, made the ball pitch and spit and stop almost at his command. He would have shown the mastery of a charmer with a mesmerised snake. Putting from off the green? That was for the old guys and the also-rans, those without the bravery or the genius to make the ball obey. So Tiger got it close and made the solid up and down. Sure, they’re part of the game and every pro relies on them, even the all-time greats. But he was coming to need them, more and more. He won’t be entirely comfortable with that. He couldn’t putt at the 11th, when he again missed right and left himself a rascal of a chip. If Tiger’s short game was as bad as it had looked last time, the ball could easily have taken a bath. Instead, he recovered, just like old times. Then put it in the water at the 12th instead. Golf’s gods thumbed their noses and pulled faces behind his back. ‘I made two dumb mistakes,’ said Woods. ‘That apart, it was a good day. The short game was my strength, it was the reason I worked my butt off — to make it my strength again.’ Even so, dramatic saves weren’t all the old Tiger was about. There was a shot on the seventh that would have been a contender for play of the day. That is why they continue to hurry when he has played, no matter the needs of his patient partners. Tiger hits and off they go to see Tiger hit again. But Tiger is hitting more and more. Not the 82 times he hit at the Waste Management Phoenix Open in January perhaps, but more times than he would have hit in such benign conditions at Augusta in the old days, when he wouldn’t have been so pleased to tie for 41st place after 18 holes. Still, the seventh. Boy it was a beauty. He was behind a tree, left of the fairway, barely in sight of the green. He took a giant hit, dug it out but with such power and ferocity. The crowd lost the flight, the cameraman too, but Woods didn’t. He skipped and peered around the forestry to see the ball drop out of the sky, onto the green to a Sunday afternoon reception. Momentarily it was 1997 all over again. And then it was 2015 again and he left his 25 footer short. Par. Woods was not impressed with his approach shot to the 10th, but he managed to salvage par on the hole . Woods' beau Lindsey Vonn was in attendance as her other half mopped his sopping brow with a towel . Woods, Jimmy Walker and Jamie Donaldson walk to the 6th green during an absorbing day's play . Increasingly, his gallery writes cheques the man in the arena cannot cash. They were 14 rows deep just to watch him walk the ten strides from putting green to first tee. Eight on one side, six on the other, five marshals, wrestling with rope, and several baseball-hatted G4 security men. A local sheriff marched past, perspiring through his regulation white shirt. Even for Augusta in April it was unseasonably warm: 89, according to the Weather Channel. It was approaching 1.48pm Eastern Time. Tiger o’clock. The 14 rows fidgeted expectantly. Tiger breezed through, to applause, cheers and the odd whoop; the love of the common people. He nodded in appreciation once, mouthed a noiseless thank you, smiled a tight anti-smile. And then he was gone. Swallowed up as the ropes dropped and the crowd fell in behind him. Will he, won’t he? Could he, couldn’t he? They had seen the man, but would they ever see The Man? He was coming here with a new game, and a new mindset, but was this a new Tiger? Woods lines up his putt on the par three sixth as the 15-time major winner had a solid start to the day . Woods shows his fury at a chip from a bunker on the fourth,  but he managed to steady the ship . Woods patrols the Augusta fairways on a largely frustrating round for the former world No 1 . No. Not a new Tiger like the old Tiger anyway. Too much, too soon. He was better than the Tiger that departed Torrey Pines in February, with fears for his long-term future. Better for all that graft, that sun up to sun down perseverance. But he was still the 111th ranked golfer in the world. A bit rusty, a bit erratic, a bit brilliant, a bit fallible. There were fine moments, but they were fleeting. He got better through the round, but he would have eaten this place alive in the good old days. And that is Tiger’s problem. It’s a bit like Al Pacino in Carlito’s Way. Every time he tries to get out, they pull him back in. The creaks, the chunks, the odd crisis of confidence that just wasn’t there before. He starts to get going, he works his ass off, but it is hard. He three-putted the first, birdied the second. Hit a tree off the tee on the third, but got a lucky kick onto the fairway. Found a bunker, then missed the green on the par three fourth, played a quite stunning second from a poor fairway lie on the fifth. It was the golf of a competitor still battling against the years, and the aches of a creaking back and — whisper it — maybe yips that could resurface at any time. He won’t go quietly, the competitor remains, but he is vulnerable now. If it is isn’t one thing, it’s the other. Woods wills his second shot from the 14th on with the galleries gripped on the unfolding soap opera . Woods looks anxiously as his tee shot from the 15th sails into the still Georgia skies on a perfect day for golf . Woods finished the day at one over as he looks forlornly at a shot on the eighth .","The Masters 2015 crowd wanted Tiger Woods to do well at Augusta .

RGF0YXNldEV4YW1wbGU6MTU5Ng==,"A sex offender has been jailed for fatally stabbing a forensic science student who dreamed of becoming a policewoman after befriending her on a canal towpath. David Marshall must serve a minimum of 20 years behind bars for the murder of Eni Mevish, a 20-year-old student at Staffordshire University. The 68-year-old stabbed her in the heart, lungs and liver six months after they met because he was 'jealous' of her other friendships, Stafford Crown Court heard. The pensioner had already served a jail sentence for assaulting a 14-year-old girl when he stormed her house Stoke-on-Trent in November last year to butcher her with a kitchen knife. Eni Mevish was killed by a sex offender who stabbed her in the lungs, liver and heart six months after she befriended him while out jogging . The pair are thought to have met around six months earlier when Miss Mevish, originally from Manchester, was out jogging. Prosecutors told the court Miss Mevish had received financial support from the pensioner, though the nature of their friendship is not clear. On November 9 the 20-year-old received a number of text messages thought to have been from Marshall. While she was watching a film with fellow student Rizwan Bukhari, Marshall is understood to have arrived at her house drunk. He asked Mr Bukhari to leave them alone before being heard 'swearing, shouting' and asking 'why didn't you text me?' The 22-year-old student then heard a 'slow scream' and tried to intervene but was struck by the sex offender's knife. David Marshall was on licence for sexually assaulting a 14-year-old girl when he killed Eni, a 20-year-old student . After Marshall had fled the scene he discovered Miss Mevish's body in a pool of blood and phoned an ambulance. She had been stabbed in her heart, liver and lungs and died in hospital. Appearing via video link in Stafford Crown Court Marshall was told he must serve a minimum term of 20 years and six months for her killing. Sentencing, Judge John Wait said it was clear the sex offender had intended to hurt her. 'You came to be jealous of her friendships with fellow students and sought to distance her from them. 'It is clear you had in mind violence when you went to her home.' The court heard how at the time of the attack Marshall was on licence for sexually assaulting a 14-year-old girl. 'At the time of this terrible offence you were on licence following a sentence for an offence of indecent assault,' added Judge Wait. 'It was a condition of your licence that you notify your supervising (probation) officer of any developing friendship with a woman. 'It is noteworthy that you failed to tell your supervising officer of the relationship (with Eni) though you were asked on many occasions.' In a statement released by police Miss Mevish was described as 'beautiful, clever and with her whole life ahead of her.' 'Eni was a loving sister and daughter who was taken from us suddenly and violently. 'We are so proud of her achievements. We are devastated by her death. 'Nothing can make up for that but we are glad Marshall is now paying for his actions.' The 20-year-old was studying to become a police woman at the time of her death. 'She would train really hard as she was so determined to join the police. 'Eni would run through the park and when she saw an officer she would say ""that’s what I want to be’""- she just wanted to help,' said close friend Melanie-Vanessa Enyong. The 20-year-old aspiring policewoman was in her second year of a degree in Policing and Criminal Investigation when she was murdered . 'She only ever wanted the best for people because she loved exercising so much she used to encourage us to get out there with her - that was the type of person she was.' She is thought to have met Marshall while out running though details of their friendship are not known. One of her former lecturers said she was a 'warm-hearted and conscientious' student. Speaking on behalf of Staffordshire University, Professor Andrew Jackson said: 'She is greatly missed by all who knew her. 'Today’s events bring that loss into sharp focus and our thoughts are particularly with her family at this very difficult time.' She is thought to have met Marshall while out running though details of their friendship are not known. In the days after her death Thomas Barnes described how her housemate, Rizwan Bucari, had come into a shop to ask for help after seeing Marshall flee her body. 'She had blood pouring from a stab wound in her stomach, and cuts all up her arm. 'By the time the ambulance arrived, her breathing was very weak. I told them what had happened and moved so I didn't get in their way. 'It was surreal, after being in direct contact with that kind of situation it’s hard to concentrate on anything else.' Marshall stormed the student's shared house in Shelton, Stoke on Trent, (street pictured above) and killed her with a kitchen knife .","Eni Mevish, 20, was stabbed to death by David Marshall, 68, last November .

RGF0YXNldEV4YW1wbGU6MTU5Nw==,"Robert Durst's first court date culminated in a shouting match after none of his lawyers' witnesses showed up. The 71-year-old real estate scion awaiting extradition to face murder charges in California appeared in New Orleans accused of illegal gun possession. His defense team was expected to challenge the case by accusing police of searching Durst's hotel room in the city without a proper arrest warrant. However, as a shackled Durst appeared to be sleeping in the courtroom, the judge raged at his attorneys for being unprepared as they requested to delay the hearing. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Controversial: Robert Durst, 71, (file image pictured) appeared to doze of in the New Orleans courtroom as his lawyers became embroiled in a shouting match with the judge after no witnesses showed up to the trial . In custody: Durst has been in custody since his arrest on March 14 and labeled a suicide risk as he waits to be extradited to California where he will be tried for the 2000 murder of his longtime friend Susan Berman . Durst was arrested on March 14 on charges of possession of a weapon by a felon and possession of a gun with a controlled substance, which carry a combined maximum sentence of 30 years in prison, but has yet to be formally charged. It was the day before the final HBO episode aired of The Jinx: The Life And Deaths Of Robert Durst. Authorities who searched the room, where Durst stayed under an alias, claim to have found over $42,000 in cash, a revolver, marijuana and a latex mask that could fit over his neck and head. FBI agents arrested Durst over fears he would flee the country, the agency has said. On Thursday, the judge eventually agreed to postpone the hearing until next week, when the witnesses - two FBI agents and a state trooper - could be charged with contempt of court for failing to appear. Long a suspect in the disappearance of his wife, Kathleen Durst, in 1982 in New York, Durst was acquitted in the dismemberment killing of his neighbor in Texas in 2003. He is now facing the death penalty in California, where he is accused of murdering his longtime friend Susan Berman in 2000. Two FBI agents and a state trooper ignored their subpoenas and could face contempt of court charges . The real estate heir was temporarily placed on suicide watch soon after his arrest. His lawyers claim his Asperger's Syndrome led him to erroneously trust the HBO producers, who screened semi-confessional interviews that will now be used against him in trial. Durst, who prosecutors have said is worth up to $100 million, has long been estranged from his powerful family, which has major New York real estate holdings. He has been held without bail at a facility for mentally ill inmates about 70 miles (110 km) from New Orleans, with local authorities having labeled him a suicide risk.","Durst, 71, was arrested in New Orleans hotel room day before HBO finale .

RGF0YXNldEV4YW1wbGU6MTU5OA==,"Samantha Cameron has made her first solo appearance of the general election with a provocative visit to a Ukip stronghold. The Prime Minister's wife swooped into Rochester and Strood, the seat held by Mark Reckless after he defected from the Tories last summer. David Cameron has made no secret of his desire to kick Mr Reckless's 'fat arse' out of the Commons, and clearly hopes his wife can woo voters in the crucial Kent battleground. Scroll down for video . Samantha Cameron has made her first solo appearance of the general election with a provocative visit to a Ukip stronghold . Mrs Cameron joined Tory candidate Kelly Tolhurst for a visit to Abbey Court School in Rainham, Kent . Mrs Cameron met Mitchell, aged four, at the Abbey Court School in Rainham, a special school  for three to 19-year-olds . She also spoke to five-year-old Jessica at the school, which aides said was 'very close to her heart' Mrs Cameron's first solo appearance three days into the campaign will be seen as a statement of intent from the Conservatives, who are desperate to wrest the seat back from Ukip following the by-election. Visiting a special school in the constituency, she joked that she was pleased that her campaigning duties did not stretch to a live TV debate. Mr Cameron is due to go head-to-head in a seven-way debate tomorrow night with the leaders of Labour, Lib Dems, Ukip, Greens, SNP and Plaid Cymru. Mrs Cameron told reporters: 'He doesn't seem too nervous but I'm very glad it's him doing it and not me.' When Mr Reckless defected from the Tories last year, the Prime Minister launched an extraordinary attack on his betrayal. Mr Cameron argued that committed volunteers have ‘knocked on doors, stuffed envelopes, licked stamps to get his fat arse on the Commons benches, and this is how he repays them’. But after the Conservatives threw the kitchen sink at the by-election triggered by his decision to join Ukip, Mr Reckless held it with a majority of 2,920. Tory sources said it remains a 'key seat' and Mrs Cameron was keen to support Miss Tolhurst who is a 'great local candidate' Mrs Cameron is expected to make a series of more stridently political interventions, after using a BBC interview last month to back her husband's bid to remain as Prime Minister . Tory sources said it remains a 'key seat' and Mrs Cameron was keen to support Tory Kelly Tolhurst who is a 'great local candidate'. Mrs Cameron is expected to make a series of more stridently political interventions, after using a BBC interview last month to back her husband's bid to remain as Prime Minister. She said: 'He's definitely for my mind the best man for the job. 'I hope that me and the family help him to keep things in perspective - keep him grounded - help him to pace himself over the next eight weeks.' Miss Tolhurst who stood against Mr Reckless at the Rochester and Strood by-election in November. She greeted Mrs Cameron as she arrived for the visit to Abbey Court School in Rainham, Kent. Mrs Cameron wore a Cos raspberry coloured blouse and a blue skirt from Toast, teamed with navy shoes from Zara. She met head teacher Karen Joy as she toured the site for three to 19-year-olds with special educational needs, which aides said was 'very close to her heart'. Mark Reckless defected from the Tories to Ukip last summer. After the Conservatives threw the kitchen sink at the subsequent by-election, Mr Reckless held it with a majority of 2,920 . In September, Mr Reckless followed Douglas Carswell to become the second Conservative to defect to Ukip. The turncoat MP was unrepentant about his defection, insisting the Tories had broken promises on immigration and reducing the deficit. Senior Conservatives reacted with fury.  Party chairman Grant Shapps used the opening speech of the Tory conference to mount a sustained attack on Mr Reckless, declaring: ‘He lied and lied and lied again.’ Mr Cameron has admitted that the pressures of wooing voters means their regular date nights will have to be put on hold. He told the Sunday Telegraph: 'I think that will probably be a bit testing. I think there won't be much time for some of those things. 'Samantha's going to be on the campaign trail with me. She has also got other things she has to do, including making sure the children make it to school every day.' In November's by-election, Mr Reckless won 42 per cent of the vote, ahead of Kelly Tolhurst on 35 per cent . Prime Minister David Cameron and Chancellor George Osborne today visited Marston's Brewery in Wolverhampton . The Tory power couple were filmed together at the weekend during a visit to Salford's Royal Hospital in Greater Manchester. Speaking to a patient, they discussed their many hospital visits with son Ivan, who died in 2009. The PM said: 'When our son was very ill, we often went into hospital and it is very difficult to get out at the weekend.' Mrs Cameron added: 'On a Friday, if we thought there was any chance that we could get home, I was like: 'We've got to get out this afternoon'.'","Tory leader's wife makes first solo trip of the general election campaign .

Competitive eater Mary Schuyler accomplished the stunning feat in front of hundreds at the Big Texan Steak Ranch restaurant in Amarillo, Texas on Sunday. Schuyler is such a champ that the four teams of two that competed against her didn't even come close to winning - even though they were allowed to split their dinners. Scroll down for video . Winner, winner, steak dinner: Molly Schuyler won the 72-ounce steak dinner challenge at the Big Texan Steack Ranch restaurant in Amarillo, Texas on Sunday . Fast eater: The 120-pound mother-of-four ate three steak dinners - complete with sides - in just 20 minutes . Worth it: For breaking the record for quickest steak dinner eaten and for finishing her three meals in under an hour, Schuyler took home a grand total of $6,000 . In addition to the three massive 72-ounce steaks, competitors also had to eat three baked potatoes, three shrimp cocktails, three salads and three rolls for a whopping 15 pounds of food. While that might sound daunting to most, Schuyler was confident that she would beat out the other competitors with her experience. 'They would have had to eat their half in like four minutes,' Schuyler told the Amarillo Globe-News. 'If you’re not used to doing this, four minutes is hard.' Filling: The dinner included three 72-ounce steaks, three shrimp cocktails, three baked potatoes, three salads and three rolls . Champion: Though her competitors were allowed to tackle the challenge in teams of two, none came close to winning the competition . She cleaned her plate: Schuyler poses with a fan after the feat, showing off her belly bloated from the competition . However, she was a bit nervous about tackling a three steak dinners since she ate just two when she competed at the restaurant last year. 'I come in thinking I'm going to fail, but you know if I win it's a lovely parting gift and that's cool,' she told KFDA-TV. 'I also get free steak so I don't really lose.' As the competition began, Schuyler covered up with a pair of sunglasses and put up her sweatshirt hood to focus on the task at hand and finished her first steak in just four minutes and 18 seconds - beating the previous record she set last year of four minutes and 48 seconds. Hundreds cheered her on below the competition table set up side the restaurant on a sunny day, as Schuyler ripped her way through the steaks. Competitors had an hour to finish their $72 dinners, in order to get them for free, but Schuyler cleaned her plates in a cool 20. And with enough time to spare, Schuyler tried attacking a fourth steak but had to stop, saying she was tired of the taste. Schuyler was born and raised in Nebraska and currently residents in Sacramento California. Before her competitive food eating life, she worked as a bartender and server at Applebee’s. In August 2012, Schuyler entered her first competitive eating competition, becoming the first woman to finish the Stellanator at Stella Bar in Omaha, Nebraska. The Stellanator includes six hamburger patties, six eggs, six pieces of cheese, six pieces of bacon topped with fried onions, jalapenos, lettuce, tomatoes, pickles, two buns and mayonnaise. Another to add to the trophy cabinet: Schuyler pictured above winning the Z-Burger contest in Washington, DC last July. During the competition she ate 24 hamburgers in ten minutes . Since then, Schuyler has been competing regularly in food eating competitions - including one weekend in 2014 when she competed in FOUR food competitions. On January 31, 2014, Schuyler won Wing Bowl 22 in Philadelphia, by eating 363 wings. The next day, she competed in and won both the IHOP Pancake bowl and the bacon-eating contest at the Blue Ribbon Bacon Festival in Des Moines. She finished out the weekend by taking on the Adam Emmenecker Challenge at Jethro’s Barbecue. Schuyler first took on the Emmenecker challenge in December 2012, when she became the first woman to complete the meal that includes a spicy pickle, bun, pork tenderloin, buffalo chicken tenders, white cheddar sauce, fried cheese cubes, Texas brisket, applewood smoked bacon, cheeseburger and a pound of waffle fries...in just 15 minutes. Dessert: Schuyler guzzles down 12 pounds of rice pudding in three minutes to set a new world record last year . Hero: Last year Mrs Schuyler smashed another record by demolishing a 12-pound sandwich, one pound of French fries and a large soda as part of the Mad Greek Deli Challenge in Portland, Oregon . Schuyler started the competition at her normal 120 pounds, but by the time she was crowned winner, she had gained 15 pounds and her stomach noticeably filled out. Her physique was quite a contrast to the larger men who decided to take her on in the eating competition including a team of two professional wrestlers and two members of the Amarillo Venum indoor football team. For setting the record for fastest eaten steak dinner, Schuyler won $1,000 and another $5,000 for completing the challenge in less than an hour. What's more - Schuyler says she plans to come back next year and break her record, upping the ante to four steaks instead of three. Bobby Lee, the co-owner of the Big Texas, says the restaurant was floored by her performance and that they'll be submitting her record to Guinness. 'We've been doing this contest since 1960, and in all that time we've never had anybody come in to actually eat that many steaks at one time- so this is a first for us and after 55 years of it, it's a big deal,' Lee told ABC 7. Schuyler started competing in eating competition in August 2012, and has broken several records during her brief career. In January 2014, she set ate 363 wings in just 20 minutes, earning $22,000 prize for that competition.","Molly Schuyler won the 72-ounce steak dinner challenge at Big Texan Steak Ranch in Amarillo, Texas on Sunday .

RGF0YXNldEV4YW1wbGU6MTYwMQ==,"Cyril Smith took the party whip for four years in Parliament and was feted as a Lib-Dem grandee in the years before he died . Nick Clegg made a desperate bid to distance his party from allegations about Cyril Smith yesterday by calling the paedophile MP a 'Labour politician'. He claimed the obese sexual predator did not belong to the Liberal Democrats at the time he was abusing scores of young boys. In fact Smith took the party whip for four years in Parliament and was feted as a Lib Dem grandee in the years before he died. Mr Clegg was accused on a radio phone-in of having 'washed his hands' of the issue by refusing to order a party investigation into Smith. He insisted there would be no inquiry despite revelations in Saturday's Daily Mail that the Liberal party – a forerunner to the Lib Dems – offered hush money equivalent to a month's wages to an activist after she complained about Smith molesting a teenage boy in 1979. Mr Clegg was confronted over the Smith scandal during a phone-in show on LBC radio yesterday. He was asked by 'John from Bexleyheath' why the Lib Dems had not investigated despite new details of Smith's prolific paedophilia exposed in this paper's serialisation of Labour politician Simon Danczuk's book about the late Rochdale MP. Mr Clegg attempted to distance the Lib Dems from Smith and said 'any political party' should co-operate with the police inquiry. He said: 'As it happens, Cyril Smith, as you may know, the allegations surrounding him, actually go right back to the time when he was a Labour politician, back, well before I was even born, I think.' Mr Clegg accused Mr Danczuk of choosing 'to airbrush out the fact that Smith was a Labour politician when he was alleged to have started abusing young children'. He added: 'Cyril Smith was active in politics, by the way, in a party which no longer exists – the Liberal party. 'So he was a Labour politician, and then he was a politician for most of his career, for a Liberal party, which no longer exists. All this happened well before the Liberal Democrats were even formed.' Mr Clegg said the only way to get justice was for the police to investigate and blamed them for not having done so. Mr Danczuk, the Labour candidate for Rochdale, said his book made it clear that Smith had started out as a member of the Labour party. Nick Clegg made a desperate attempt to distance his party from allegations about Cyril Smith today by calling the paedophile MP a 'Labour politician' He added: 'Nobody will be surprised to hear that Nick Clegg is being disingenuous in his comments. Mr Clegg accused Labour's Simon Danczuk (pictured) of choosing 'to airbrush out the fact that actually Cyril Smith was a Labour politician when he was alleged to have started abusing young children'. 'I urge him to face up to the fact that one of his colleagues – somebody who he and other members of his party celebrated for very many years – was a paedophile. 'I think it is a disgrace to try to avoid tackling this issue and to try to politicise this issue in the way that he is doing.' Smith was elected as a Liberal MP in 1972, but after the Lib Dems were formed in 1988 took the whip of the new party until his retirement from Parliament in 1992. He remained a Liberal Democrat grandee up to his death in 2010 at the age of 82. A gushing video tribute from Mr Clegg was played at Smith's 80th birthday party at Rochdale town hall in 2008. The Lib Dem leader told him: 'I'm a great admirer of you personally, but also owe you a great debt of gratitude politically too.' The Daily Mail's serialisation of Mr Danczuk's book, Smile For The Camera: The Double Life Of Cyril Smith, revealed that senior Liberals were made aware of the paedophile MP's abuse. Lord Steel, who as David Steel was Liberal leader from 1976 until 1988 and nominated Smith for a knighthood, was alerted in 1979 to claims that Smith had subjected boys to humiliating spankings but Smith denied any wrongdoing. Senior Lib Dems including the Business Secretary Vince Cable and the former leader Charles Kennedy have insisted they heard nothing. The party has been accused of 'squirming' over the issue.","Lib Dem leader makes desperate attempt to distance party from allegations .

RGF0YXNldEV4YW1wbGU6MTYwMw==,"Kelly Ripa has been grief stricken following the sad news that her friend, cosmetic surgeon Dr Fredric Brandt, was found dead by suicide at his Miami mansion on Sunday. So it's understandable that 44-year-old TV star was looking morose as she left her New York City apartment on Tuesday. The Live With Kelly & Michael co-host, who is usually seen smiling, wore a frown as she left the building alone. When appearing on her morning show she said, 'He was such a great man... he was just a great person, a great friend, he will be missed - I cannot tell you how much I will miss him. I will miss him every day of my life.' Sad day: Kelly Ripa looked to be in mourning on Tuesday as she left her NYC apartment; on Sunday it was announced her surgeon friend Dr Fredric Brandt had died . The personality added, 'If you love someone tell them every day that you love them because you don't know if you will have that opportunity.... It's sad. Oh my gosh, he was just the best. He would sing to you while he put Botox in your face - any song you wanted. He could sing anything at a moment's notice.' The former soap opera actress was dressed casually in a yellow sweater and worn-in jeans. Comfortable short beige boots and aviators completed her look. It seemed as if Ripa had wet hair and hardly any makeup on. The beauty was carrying her coat as well as some papers, a cell phone and her purse. Casual look: The former soap opera actress was dressed down in a yellow sweater and worn-in jeans. Comfortable short beige boots and aviators completed her look.

Feeling the pain: On her show Live With Kelly & Michael, the host told Michael Strahan that she will miss the doctor who had worked on the morning program .

He could sing anything at a moment's notice' The day before the New Yorker tweeted her condolences for Dr Brandt, 65, who was highly-regarded for his cosmetic work across the industry.  Madonna and Stephanie Seymour were clients. 'My heart is breaking for the loss of Dr. Fredric Brandt. My friend. You will be missed forever and in my heart even longer,' the star wrote. Her husband Mark Consuelos, retweeted choreographer Isaac Calpito's post, which read: 'Devastated over the loss of our dear friend @drfredricbrandt. You are missed. You are loved. The world has lost one of its kindest souls.' They were close: Dr  Brandt was remembered by  Ripa (left with the surgeon in 2011) in a tweet on Monday following his tragic suicide at his Miami home on Sunday . Comedian and former The View star, Joy Behar, tweeted on Monday: 'Dr Brandt was one of the sweetest, nicest, most generous people I have had the good fortune to meet & work with. He will be sorely missed.' The City of Miami Police Department confirmed that Dr Brandt's death on Sunday was a suicide by hanging. An autopsy was scheduled on Monday, the coroner confirmed. Miami Herald columnist, Lesley Abravanel had said Brandt had been 'devastated' recently over rumors comparing him to a character on the Netflix show, Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt. Her note: The 44-year-old beauty's tweet said, 'My heart is breaking for the loss of Dr. Fredric Brandt. My friend. You will be missed forever and in my heart even longer' Abravanel, a Miami Herald columnist, posted a series of tweets on Sunday claiming that he had been 'devastated' by unflattering comparisons to Dr Franff on the  Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt, according to  sources close to the doctor. The doctor's longtime publicist Jacquie Tractenberg told The New York Post on Monday: 'The show definitely deeply hurt him, he was being made fun of because of the way he looks. 'It is mean, and it was bullying. But the show was not the reason for his depression, and it was not the reason he would take his own life.' The Tractenberg & Co PR agency did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Daily Mail Online. Was he bullied?: Dr  Brandt (left) has a resemblance to Dr Franff (right), a character on Tina Fey's Netflix show, Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt. He was reportedly 'devastated' by the portrayal . His colleague, Dr Robert Anolik, who worked with Brandt at his practice, posted a moving tribute on Monday. The acclaimed dermatologist wrote: 'Dr. Fredric Brandt died yesterday. For nearly 5 years, Fred and I worked side by side. He was far more than a colleague to me. He was a close friend. I will miss him every day.' The doctor was found dead at his Coconut Grove mansion in Miami by his housekeeper where he lived alone. She called 911 at 9.17am, according to a police statement. The Miami-Dade County Medical Examiner Department confirmed that an autopsy will be conducted on Monday. The New York Post also wrote a column last month comparing the real-life doctor to the fictional doctor on Tina Fey's hit comedy. 'Sources: Dr Fredric Brandt was ""devastated"" over comparisons to the protagonist on Tina Fey’s new Netflix show, “Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt"",' Abravanel tweeted. Behar tweeted on Monday: 'Dr Brandt was one of the sweetest, nicest, most generous people I have had the good fortune to meet & work with. He will be sorely missed' An eye for art: Dr Brandt, a cosmetic dermatologist and well-known art collector pictured in front of a piece from his collection at his apartment in New York City on March 7, 2014 . Dr Franff only appears in one episode, titled 'Kimmy Goes To The Doctor!', of the first season. The character shares Dr Brandt’s smooth skin, platinum blond hair and enthusiasm for plastic surgery, but his door sign claims he’s a ‘board certified D, DS, DDSOBGYN’, rather than a cosmetic dermatologist. The Dr Franff character is depicted on the Netflix show with a high-pitched laugh and unable to speak certain words due to his plastic surgery. He is also seen drinking  from a surgical bag and reinflates his own face after being punched. Netflix had no comment when contacted by Daily Mail Online. Dr Brandt was famed for his appearance, which displayed many of his dermatology techniques. In a 2014 profile in The New York Times, he said that his goal was to 'restore the face to harmony'. 'I approach each face with a visual perception, an artistic perception and a medical perception,' he said. The article, which described the doctor as an 'unnervingly ageless-looking personage', said that he was sought out by the rich and famous for his signature Y lifts, where fillers are injected below the cheekbones. Abravanel said that sources told her Dr Brandt was 'devastated' over comparisons to the enthusiastic doctor on Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt . The plastic surgeon, Dr Franff, in the Netflix comedy, is played by comedy veteran Martin Short and had drawn unflattering comparisons to real-life Dr Brandt. In one scene, where the lead character Kimmy almost gets plastic surgery, the doctor is seen drinking from a hamster feeder . Martin Short had a small role as Dr Franff in one episode of the TV show's first season. When he is punched by the main character, Kimmy, as she struggles to escape the plastic surgeon's chair, his face dents like putty - which he then inflates with an air tube . Dr Franff appears in episode four of the first and only season of Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt. He's a botox-loving plastic surgeon played by Martin Short. The show follows a Kimmy (Ellie Kemper), who was rescued from an underground bunker after years of being held hostage by a cult leader. She then is hired to be a nanny for the step-children of socialite Jacqueline (Jane Krakowski). In the fourth episode of the show, Jacqueline visits Dr Franff to discuss a 'foot lift' of sorts because she believes that 'feet are the new butts'. In the fourth episode of the Netflix show's first and only season, Dr Franff makes a short appearance as a cosmetic doctor who consults with Kimmy (Ellie Kemper) and Jacqueline (Jane Krakowski, pictured) Dr Franff's almost-overly smooth skin and platinum blond hair share a resemblance with that of Dr Fredric Brandt, who is known for being the cosmetic dermatologist of stars including Madonna and Stephanie Seymour. Franff is portrayed as a deranged doctor, whose face is so frozen from plastic surgery and other procedures that he even has trouble forming words at times. In the episode, he cheerily suggests several barbaric-sounding surgeries for Jacqueline, as well as on Kimmy.","Cosmetic dermatologist to the stars Fredric Brandt was found dead at his Coconut Grove home in Miami on Sunday, aged 65 .

RGF0YXNldEV4YW1wbGU6MTYwNA==,"Holocaust survivors have gathered at the site of the former Bergen-Belsen concentration camp to commemorate the anniversary of its liberation. More than 72,000 camp inmates and prisoners of war died at the Nazi camp including diarist Anne Frank and her older sister Margot. British soldiers liberated the camp on April 15, 1945. Today, seventy years on, hundreds of people sobbed as they laid flowers and flags as memorials. Scroll down for video . Survivor Marie Vaislic from France sits on a mass grave reading '1000 dead rest here' after the ceremony. It was held to mark the 70th anniversary of the liberation of the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp in northern Germany . Officials also attended the ceremony including Joachim Gauck, the German president, who said the British soldiers were 'ambassadors of a democratic culture who were not looking for revenge'. He added: 'We commit ourselves to the obligation of never denying these crimes and of preserving the memories of the victims.' Ronald Lauder, president of the World Jewish Congress, also attended the memorial. He told an audience: 'Right now, we stand on one of the largest Jewish cemeteries in the world. But there are no gravestones, there are no markers. An elderly woman covers her mouth in disbelief as she looks at the mourning wall at the former concentration camp, where more than 72,000 camp inmates and prisoners of war died . Red and white roses, yellow tulips and stones lay on and in front of the gravestone of diarist Anne Frank and her older sister Margot . Women and men mourn as wreaths of blue, white, red and yellow flowers are laid on the memorial. British soldiers took over the camp on April 15, 1945 . Joachim Gauck, the German president pictured (above) during the ceremony, said the British soldiers who liberated the camp were 'ambassadors of a democratic culture' 'The victims buried here lost not just their lives; the Nazis took their identities as well.' Lauder also warned that anti-Semitism is on the rise again in Europe, 70 years after the end of the Holocaust. 'Today, 70 years after this camp was liberated, we hear the same anti-Semitic lies. 'Today, a Jewish boy wearing a yarmulke cannot walk down the street in Paris or London or Copenhagen without fearing for his life.' Anne Frank's diary recounts how her family went into hiding from the Nazis in the Netherlands during the Second World War. It became a bestseller when it was published at the end of the war. The book documents how Anne, her sister Margot and her family went into hiding in a canal house. They were eventually betrayed and sent to Bergen-Belsen, where she and her sister died. After the war the Dutch government set the official date of Anne's death as March 31, based on survivors accounts stating that the girls died sometime in March. But some accounts suggest that she might have died in the middle of February - just two months before British soldiers liberated the camp. It is likely she caught typhus, which was rife in the overcrowded camp. Her sister Margot also passed away and experts think she too had the disease. Their grave, which reads Margot Frank 1926 - 1945 and Anne Frank 1929 - 1945, is a poignant memorial that still stands where the Nazi camp used to be. Red and white roses, yellow tulips and stones were laid carefully around the grave earlier today.

British soldiers freed around 60,000 prisoners but discovered tens of thousands of bodies of people who had died from extreme overcrowding, disease and starvation. Typhus, which Miss Frank is thought to have died from, was particularly rife. Ceremonies have been held across Germany and Poland throughout the spring marking the advance of Allied troops as Nazi Germany neared defeat. They are even more poignant this year because of the dwindling number of survivors and witnesses to the Holocaust, the murder of six million Jews by the regime of Adolf Hitler. Ceremonies were also taking place today at the former Flossenbürg camp in southern Germany, where around 30,000 people died between 1938 and 1945.
