  The Phoenix app can be run in various notebook environments such as colab and
  SageMaker as well as be served via the terminal or a docker container

### Notebooks

To start phoenix in the notebook environment, run:

```python
import phoenix as px

session = px.launch_app()
```

This will start a local Phoenix server. You can initialize the phoenix server with various types of datasets (traces, inferences). Check out the [API for details](how-to/manage-the-app.md)

{% hint style="info" %}
When running phoenix in the notebook, by default it does not persist your data.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

### Container

{% hint style="info" %}
Container images are still actively being worked on. If you are interested in hosted phoenix, please get in touch!
{% endhint %}

Phoenix server images are  available via [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/arizephoenix/phoenix). The hosted phoenix server runs as a trace collector and can be used if you want observability for LLM traces via docker compose or simply want a long-running phoenix instance. Below are examples of how to run phoenix va Docker for a specific version.

First pull the image you want to run (note you can use the tag `latest` if you would just like the latest version)

```bash
docker pull arizephoenix/phoenix:version-2.9.3
```

Now you can run the image you pulled (note you must expose the port `6006` so you can view the UI).

```bash
docker run -p 6006:6006 arizephoenix/phoenix:version-2.9.3
```

The Phoenix UI will be available at `localhost:6006`.

If you deploy the phoenix server (collector) to a remote machine, you will have to make sure to configure the remote endpoint as the collector endpoint. (This feature is only available after phoenix **1.3.x**)

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Set Endpoint Environment Variable" %}
```python
import os

os.environ["PHOENIX_COLLECTOR_ENDPOINT"] = "http://123.456.789:6006"
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

Note that the above is only necessary if your application is running in a Jupyter notebook. If you are trying to deploy your application and have phoenix collect traces via a container, please consult the [deployment guide.](deployment/deploying-phoenix.md)

### Terminal

If you want to start a phoenix server to collect traces, you can also run phoenix directly from the command line

```bash
python3 -m phoenix.server.main serve
```

This will start the phoenix server on port 6006. If you are running your instrumented notebook or application on the same machine, traces should automatically be exported to `http://127.0.0.1:6006` so no additional configuration is needed. However if the server is running remotely, you will have to modify the environment variable `PHOENIX_COLLECTOR_ENDPOINT` to point to that machine (e.g. `http://<my-remote-machine>:<port>`)

Note that this command has various configuration options such as `--host` and `--port`. For example:

```bash
python3 -m phoenix.server.main --port 1234 --host 0.0.0.0 serve
```
