Phoenix's notebook-first approach to observability makes it a great tool to utilize during experimentation and pre-production. However at some point you are going to want to ship your application and continue to monitor your application as it runs.&#x20;

In order to run Phoenix tracing in production, you will have to follow these following steps:

1. [**Setup a Server**](deploying-phoenix.md#setup-a-server)**:** your LLM application to run on a server
2. [**Instrument**](deploying-phoenix.md#instrument): Add [OpenInference](https://github.com/Arize-ai/openinference) Instrumentation to your server&#x20;
3. [**Observe**](deploying-phoenix.md#observe): Run the Phoenix server as or a standalone instance and point your tracing instrumentation to the phoenix server

## Setup a Server

Setting up a server to run your LLM application can be tricky to bootstrap. While bootstrapping and LLM application is not part of Phoenix, you can take a look at some of examples from our partners.

* [**create-llama**](https://blog.llamaindex.ai/create-llama-a-command-line-tool-to-generate-llamaindex-apps-8f7683021191): A bootstrapping tool for setting up a full-stack LlamaIndex app
* [**langchain-templates**](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain/blob/master/templates/README.md): Create a Langchain server using a template

{% endhint %}

## Instrument

In order to make your LLM application observable, it must be **instrumented**. That is, the code must emit traces. The instrumented data must then be sent to an Observability backend, in our case the Phoenix server.

Phoenix collects traces from your running application using OTLP (OpenTelemetry Protocol). Notably, Phoenix accepts traces produced via instrumentation provided by [OpenInference](https://github.com/Arize-ai/openinference). OpenInference instrumentations automatically instrument your code so that LLM Traces can be exported and collected by Phoenix. To learn more about instrumentation, check out the full details [here](../tracing/how-to-tracing/instrumentation/).

OpenInference currently supports instrumenting your application in both Python and Javascript.  For each of these languages, you will first need to install the `opentelemetry` and `openinference` packages necessary to trace your application.

### Install OpenTelemetry

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Python Dependancies" %}
{% hint style="info" %}
For a comprehensive guide to python instrumentation, please consult [OpenTelemetry's guide](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/languages/python/)
{% endhint %}

### Install OpenTelemetry packages

```
pip install opentelemetry-api opentelemetry-instrumentation opentelemetry-semantic-conventions opentelemetry-exporter-otlp-proto-http
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Javascript Dependancies" %}
{% hint style="info" %}
For a comprehensive guide on instrumenting NodeJS using OpenTelemetry, consult their [guide](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/languages/js/)
{% endhint %}

```
npm install  @opentelemetry/exporter-trace-otlp-proto @opentelemetry/resources @opentelemetry/sdk-trace-node --save
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

### Install OpenInference Instrumentations

To have your code produce LLM spans using OpenInference, you must pick the appropriate instrumentation packages and install them using a package manager. For a comprehensive list of instrumentations, checkout the [OpenInference](https://github.com/Arize-ai/openinference) repository.

### Initialize Instrumentation

In order for your application to export traces, it must be instrumented using OpenInference instrumentors. Note that instrumentation strategies differ by language so please consult OpenTelemetry's [guidelines for full details.](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/languages/)

{% hint style="info" %}
Note that the below examples assume you are running phoenix via docker compose and thus simply have the URL http://phoenix:6006. If you are deploying phoenix separately, replace this string with the full URL of your running phoenix instance&#x20;
{% endhint %}

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Python" %}
Below is a example of what instrumentation might look like for LlamaIndex. `instrument` should be called before `main` is run in your server.

```python
from openinference.instrumentation.llama_index import LlamaIndexInstrumentor
from opentelemetry import trace as trace_api
from opentelemetry.exporter.otlp.proto.http.trace_exporter import OTLPSpanExporter
from opentelemetry.sdk import trace as trace_sdk
from opentelemetry.sdk.trace.export import SimpleSpanProcessor


def instrument():
    tracer_provider = trace_sdk.TracerProvider()
    span_exporter = OTLPSpanExporter("http://phoenix:6006/v1/traces")
    span_processor = SimpleSpanProcessor(span_exporter)
    tracer_provider.add_span_processor(span_processor)
    trace_api.set_tracer_provider(tracer_provider)
    LlamaIndexInstrumentor().instrument()
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Javascript" %}
{% hint style="danger" %}
Code below is written in ESM format
{% endhint %}

For instrumentation to work with NodeJS to work, you must create a file `instrumentation.js` and have it run **BEFORE** all other server code in `index.js`

place the following code in a `instrumentation.js` file&#x20;

```typescript
import { registerInstrumentations } from "@opentelemetry/instrumentation";
import { OpenAIInstrumentation } from "@arizeai/openinference-instrumentation-openai";
import {
  ConsoleSpanExporter,
  SimpleSpanProcessor,
} from "@opentelemetry/sdk-trace-base";
import { NodeTracerProvider } from "@opentelemetry/sdk-trace-node";
import { Resource } from "@opentelemetry/resources";
import { OTLPTraceExporter } from "@opentelemetry/exporter-trace-otlp-proto";
import { SemanticResourceAttributes } from "@opentelemetry/semantic-conventions";
import { diag, DiagConsoleLogger, DiagLogLevel } from "@opentelemetry/api";

// For troubleshooting, set the log level to DiagLogLevel.DEBUG
diag.setLogger(new DiagConsoleLogger(), DiagLogLevel.DEBUG);

const provider = new NodeTracerProvider({
  resource: new Resource({
    [SemanticResourceAttributes.SERVICE_NAME]: "openai-service",
  }),
});

provider.addSpanProcessor(new SimpleSpanProcessor(new ConsoleSpanExporter()));
provider.addSpanProcessor(
  new SimpleSpanProcessor(
    new OTLPTraceExporter({
      url: "http://localhost:6006/v1/traces",
    }),
  ),
);
provider.register();

registerInstrumentations({
  instrumentations: [new OpenAIInstrumentation({})],
});

console.log("ðŸ‘€ OpenInference initialized");// Some code
```

Then make sure that this file is required before running the server.

```
node -r instrumentation.js index.js
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

## Observe

Lastly, we must run the phoenix server so that our application can export spans to it. To do this, we recommend running phoenix via an image. Phoenix images are available via dockerhub.

{% embed url="https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/arizephoenix/phoenix/general" %}

In order to run the phoenix server, you will have to start the application. Below are a few examples of how you can run the application on your local machine.

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Docker" %}
Pull the image you would like to run

```
docker pull arizephoenix/phoenix
```

Pick an image you would like to run or simply run the latest:

{% hint style="danger" %}
Note, you should pin the phoenix version for production to the version of phoenix you plan on using. E.x. arizephoenix/phoenix:4.0.0
{% endhint %}

```
docker run -p 6006:6006 -p 4317:4317 -i -t arizephoenix/phoenix:latest
```

See [#ports](../setup/configuration.md#ports "mention")for details on the ports for the container.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Command Line" %}
```sh
python3 -m phoenix.server.main serve
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

Note that the above simply starts the phoenix server locally. A simple way to make sure your application always has a running phoenix server as a collector is to run the phoenix server as a side car.

Here is an example **compose.yaml**

```yaml
services:
  phoenix:
    image: arizephoenix/phoenix:latest
    ports:
      - "6006:6006"  # UI and OTLP HTTP collector
      - "4317:4317"  # OTLP gRPC collector
  backend:
    build:
      context: ./backend
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
      args:
        OPENAI_API_KEY: ${OPENAI_API_KEY}
    ports:
      - "8000:8000"
    environment:
      - OPENAI_API_KEY=${OPENAI_API_KEY}
      - COLLECTOR_ENDPOINT=http://phoenix:6006/v1/traces
      - PROD_CORS_ORIGIN=http://localhost:3000
      # Set INSTRUMENT_LLAMA_INDEX=false to disable instrumentation
      - INSTRUMENT_LLAMA_INDEX=true
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD", "wget", "--spider", "http://0.0.0.0:8000/api/chat/healthcheck"]
      interval: 5s
      timeout: 1s
      retries: 5
  frontend:
    build: frontend
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    depends_on:
      backend:
        condition: service_healthy
```

This way you will always have a running Phoenix instance when you run

```
docker compose up
```
