# How-to: Datasets

## How to create datasets

Datasets are critical assets for building robust prompts, evals, fine-tuning, and much more. Phoenix allows you to build datasets manually, programmatically, or from files.

* [Create datasets from CSV](creating-datasets.md#from-csv)
* [Create datasets from Pandas](creating-datasets.md#create-datasets-from-pandas)
* [Create datasets from spans](creating-datasets.md#from-spans)
* [Create datasets using synthetic data](creating-datasets.md#syntetic-data)

## Exporting datasets

Export datasets for offline analysis, evals, and fine-tuning.

* [#exporting-to-csv](exporting-datasets.md#exporting-to-csv "mention") - how to quickly download a dataset to use elsewhere
* [Exporting to OpenAI Ft](exporting-datasets.md#exporting-for-fine-tuning) -  want to fine tune an LLM for better accuracy and cost? Export llm examples for fine-tuning.
* [Exporting to OpenAI Evals](exporting-datasets.md#exporting-openai-evals) - have some good examples to use for benchmarking of llms using OpenAI evals? export to OpenAI evals format.
