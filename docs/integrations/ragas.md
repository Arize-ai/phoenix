# Ragas

Building a baseline for a RAG pipeline is not usually difficult, but enhancing it to make it suitable for production and ensuring the quality of your responses is almost always hard. Choosing the right tools and parameters for RAG can itself be challenging when there is an abundance of options available. With Ragas and Phoenix you create a robust workflow for making the right choices while building your RAG and ensuring its quality.
