AutoGen is a new agent framework from Microsoft that allows for complex Agent creation. It is unique in its ability to create multiple agents that work together.

The AutoGen Agent framework allows creation of multiple agents and connection of those agents to work together to accomplish tasks.

```python
from phoenix.trace.openai.instrumentor import OpenAIInstrumentor
from phoenix.trace.openai import OpenAIInstrumentor
import phoenix as px

px.launch_app()
OpenAIInstrumentor().instrument()
```

The Phoenix support is simple in its first incarnation but allows for capturing all of the prompt and responses that occur under the framework between each agent.

The individual prompt and responses are captured directly through OpenAI calls.

As callbacks are supported in AutoGen Phoenix will add more agent level information.
