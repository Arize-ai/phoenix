# How-to: Interact with Traces

Once you've traced your application and collected those traces in Phoenix, you can interact with them in a few ways:

1. [Export Data & Query Spans](extract-data-from-spans.md) to run [evaluations](../../evaluation/llm-evals.md).
2. [Capture feedback](capture-feedback.md) on your traces
3. [Log evaluation results](llm-evaluations.md) back to Phoenix

These guides will show you how to handle each of these tasks, however if you're looking for an end-to-end guide on how to evaluate your traces, we recommend checking out: [evaluating-phoenix-traces.md](../../evaluation/how-to-evals/evaluating-phoenix-traces.md "mention")
