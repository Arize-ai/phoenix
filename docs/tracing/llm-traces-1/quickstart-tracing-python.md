# Quickstart: Tracing (Python)

## Overview

Phoenix supports three main options to collect traces:

1. Use [Phoenix's decorators](../how-to-tracing/setup-tracing/instrument-python.md) to mark functions and code blocks.
2. Use [automatic instrumentation](https://arize.com/docs/phoenix/integrations) to capture all calls made to supported frameworks.
3. Use [base OpenTelemetry ](../how-to-tracing/setup-tracing/custom-spans.md)instrumentation. Supported in [Python](../how-to-tracing/setup-tracing/custom-spans.md) and [TS / JS](../how-to-tracing/setup-tracing/javascript.md), among many other languages.

This example uses options 1 and 2.

## Launch Phoenix

{% include "../../.gitbook/includes/launch-phoenix-python.md" %}

## Connect to Phoenix <a href="#connect-your-app" id="connect-your-app"></a>

To collect traces from your application, you must configure an OpenTelemetry TracerProvider to send traces to Phoenix.

```bash
pip install arize-phoenix-otel
```

```python
from phoenix.otel import register

# configure the Phoenix tracer
tracer_provider = register(
  project_name="my-llm-app", # Default is 'default'
  auto_instrument=True, # See 'Trace all calls made to a library' below
)
tracer = tracer_provider.get_tracer(__name__)
```

## Trace your own functions

Functions can be traced using decorators:

```python
@tracer.chain
def my_func(input: str) -> str:
    return "output"
```

Input and output attributes are set automatically based on `my_func`'s parameters and return.

## Trace all calls made to a library

Phoenix can also capture all calls made to supported libraries automatically. Just install the [respective OpenInference library](broken-reference):

```
pip install openinference-instrumentation-openai
```

{% hint style="warning" %}
OpenInference libraries must be installed _**before**_ calling the register function
{% endhint %}

```python
# Add OpenAI API Key
import os
import openai

os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "ADD YOUR OPENAI API KEY"

client = openai.OpenAI()
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-4o",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Write a haiku."}],
)
print(response.choices[0].message.content)
```

## View your Traces in Phoenix

You should now see traces in Phoenix!
