Traces that are sent to a project are automatically indexed for metrics. This lets you quickly identify areas of poor performance. The project metrics dashboard includes:\


* Trace latency and errors
* &#x20;Latency Quantiles
* Annotation Scores Timeseries
* Cost over Time by token type
* Top Models by Cost
* Token Usage by token type
* Top Models by Tokens
* LLM Invocation and Errors
* Tool calls and Errors

## Next Steps

* How to configure [cost-tracking](../how-to-tracing/cost-tracking/ "mention")
