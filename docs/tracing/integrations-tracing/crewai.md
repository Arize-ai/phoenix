## Launch Phoenix

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Notebook" %}
**Install packages:**

```bash
pip install arize-phoenix
```

**Launch Phoenix:**

```python
import phoenix as px
px.launch_app()
```

**Connect your notebook to Phoenix:**

```python
from phoenix.otel import register

tracer_provider = register(
  project_name="my-llm-app", # Default is 'default'
)
```

{% hint style="info" %}
By default, notebook instances do not have persistent storage, so your traces will disappear after the notebook is closed. See [persistence.md](../../deployment/persistence.md "mention") or use one of the other deployment options to retain traces.
{% endhint %}
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Command Line" %}
**Launch your local Phoenix instance:**

```bash
python3 -m phoenix.server.main serve
```

For details on customizing a local terminal deployment, see [Terminal Setup](https://docs.arize.com/phoenix/setup/environments#terminal).

**Install packages:**

```bash
pip install arize-phoenix-otel
```

**Connect your application to your instance using:**

```python
from phoenix.otel import register

tracer_provider = register(
  project_name="my-llm-app", # Default is 'default'
  endpoint="http://localhost:6006/v1/traces",
)
```

See [deploying-phoenix.md](../../deployment/deploying-phoenix.md "mention") for more details
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Docker" %}
**Pull latest Phoenix image from** [**Docker Hub**](https://hub.docker.com/r/arizephoenix/phoenix)**:**

```bash
docker pull arizephoenix/phoenix:latest
```

**Run your containerized instance:**

```bash
docker run -p 6006:6006 arizephoenix/phoenix:latest
```

This will expose the Phoenix on `localhost:6006`

**Install packages:**

```bash
pip install arize-phoenix-otel
```

**Connect your application to your instance using:**

```python
from phoenix.otel import register

tracer_provider = register(
  project_name="my-llm-app", # Default is 'default'
  endpoint="http://localhost:6006/v1/traces",
)
```

For more info on using Phoenix with Docker, see [#docker](crewai.md#docker "mention")
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="app.phoenix.arize.com" %}
If you don't want to host an instance of Phoenix yourself or use a notebook instance, you can use a persistent instance provided on our site. Sign up for an Arize Phoenix account at[https://app.phoenix.arize.com/login](https://app.phoenix.arize.com/login)

**Install packages:**

```bash
pip install arize-phoenix-otel
```

**Connect your application to your cloud instance:**

```python
import os
from phoenix.otel import register

# Add Phoenix API Key for tracing
os.environ["PHOENIX_CLIENT_HEADERS"] = "api_key=...:..."

# configure the Phoenix tracer
register(
  project_name="my-llm-app", # Default is 'default'
  endpoint="https://app.phoenix.arize.com/v1/traces",
)
```

Your **Phoenix API key** can be found on the Keys section of your [dashboard](https://app.phoenix.arize.com).
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

## Install

```bash
pip install openinference-instrumentation-crewai crewai crewai-tools
```

## Setup

Initialize the CrewAIInstrumentor before your application code.

```python
from openinference.instrumentation.crewai import CrewAIInstrumentor

CrewAIInstrumentor().instrument(tracer_provider=tracer_provider)
```

CrewAI uses either Langchain or LiteLLM under the hood to call models, depending on the version.&#x20;

If you're using **CrewAI<0.63.0**, we recommend adding our `LangChainInstrumentor` to get visibility of LLM calls.

```python
from openinference.instrumentation.langchain import LangChainInstrumentor

LangChainInstrumentor().instrument(tracer_provider=tracer_provider)
```

If you're using **CrewAI>= 0.63.0**, we recommend adding our `LiteLLMInstrumentor` to get visibility of LLM calls.

```
from openinference.instrumentation.litellm import LiteLLMInstrumentor

LiteLLMInstrumentor().instrument(tracer_provider=tracer_provider)
```



## Run CrewAI

From here, you can run CrewAI as normal

```python
import os
from crewai import Agent, Task, Crew, Process
from crewai_tools import SerperDevTool

os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY"
os.environ["SERPER_API_KEY"] = "YOUR_SERPER_API_KEY"
search_tool = SerperDevTool()

# Define your agents with roles and goals
researcher = Agent(
  role='Senior Research Analyst',
  goal='Uncover cutting-edge developments in AI and data science',
  backstory="""You work at a leading tech think tank.
  Your expertise lies in identifying emerging trends.
  You have a knack for dissecting complex data and presenting actionable insights.""",
  verbose=True,
  allow_delegation=False,
  # You can pass an optional llm attribute specifying what model you wanna use.
  # llm=ChatOpenAI(model_name="gpt-3.5", temperature=0.7),
  tools=[search_tool]
)
writer = Agent(
  role='Tech Content Strategist',
  goal='Craft compelling content on tech advancements',
  backstory="""You are a renowned Content Strategist, known for your insightful and engaging articles.
  You transform complex concepts into compelling narratives.""",
  verbose=True,
  allow_delegation=True
)

# Create tasks for your agents
task1 = Task(
  description="""Conduct a comprehensive analysis of the latest advancements in AI in 2024.
  Identify key trends, breakthrough technologies, and potential industry impacts.""",
  expected_output="Full analysis report in bullet points",
  agent=researcher
)

task2 = Task(
  description="""Using the insights provided, develop an engaging blog
  post that highlights the most significant AI advancements.
  Your post should be informative yet accessible, catering to a tech-savvy audience.
  Make it sound cool, avoid complex words so it doesn't sound like AI.""",
  expected_output="Full blog post of at least 4 paragraphs",
  agent=writer
)

# Instantiate your crew with a sequential process
crew = Crew(
  agents=[researcher, writer],
  tasks=[task1, task2],
  verbose=2, # You can set it to 1 or 2 to different logging levels
  process = Process.sequential
)

# Get your crew to work!
result = crew.kickoff()

print("######################")
print(result)

```

## Observe

Now that you have tracing setup, all calls to your Crew will be streamed to your running Phoenix for observability and evaluation.
