Using Phoenix as a backend, Prompts can be managed and manipulated via code by using our Python or TypeScript SDKs.

With the Phoenix Client SDK you can:

* [Create / Update](../how-to-prompts/create-a-prompt.md#using-the-phoenix-client) prompts dynamically
* [Pull prompts](../how-to-prompts/using-a-prompt.md) templates by name, version, or tag
* [Format prompt](../how-to-prompts/using-a-prompt.md#using-a-prompt) templates with runtime variables and use them in your code.  Native support for OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, Vercel AI SDK, and more. No propriatry client necessary.
* Support for [tool calling](https://app.gitbook.com/s/fqGNxHHFrgwnCxgUBNsJ/prompt-engineering/prompts-concepts#tools) and [response formats](https://app.gitbook.com/s/fqGNxHHFrgwnCxgUBNsJ/prompt-engineering/prompts-concepts#response-format). Execute tools defined within the prompt. Phoenix prompts encompasses more than just the text and messages.
