Using Phoenix as a backend, Prompts can be managed and manipulated via code by using our Python or TypeScript SDKs.

With the Phoenix SDK you can:

* Create / Update prompts dynamically
* Load prompts templates by name, version, or tag
* Format prompt templates with runtime variables and use them in your code
* Execute tools defined within the prompt

To learn more about managing Prompts in code, see [using-a-prompt.md](../how-to-prompts/using-a-prompt.md "mention")
