# Release Notes

02.19.2025: Prompts üìÉ

**Available in Phoenix 8.0+**

![](https://storage.googleapis.com/arize-phoenix-assets/assets/images/s-prompts.png)

Phoenix prompt management will now let you create, modify, tag, and version control prompts for your applications!  These are some more highlights from this release:&#x20;

* Native prompt, tool, parameter, and response format normalization for OpenAI, Anthropic, Azure Open AI, Google AI Studio.
* Prompt metadata propagation on Playground spans and experiment metadata on Playground dataset runs.
* Playground Hotkeys and major performance optimizations in the template editors.
* A new TypeScript client for syncing prompts with your JavaScript runtime, including native support for OpenAI, Anthropic, and the Vercel AI SDK.
* A new Python client for syncing templates and applying them to AI SDKs like OpenAI, Anthropic, and others.

Check out the [docs](../prompt-engineering/overview-prompts.md) for more on prompts and other new features! &#x20;

## 01.18.2025: Automatic & Manual Span Tracing ‚öôÔ∏è

**Available in Phoenix 7.9+**

![](https://storage.googleapis.com/arize-phoenix-assets/assets/images/s-tracing.png)

In addition to using our [automatic instrumentors](../tracing/integrations-tracing/) and [tracing directly using OTEL](../tracing/how-to-tracing/custom-spans.md), we've now added our  own layer to let you have the granularity of manual instrumentation without as much boilerplate code.

You can now access a tracer object with streamlined options to trace functions and code blocks. The main two options are:

* Using the **decorator** `@tracer.chain` traces the entire function automatically as a Span in Phoenix. The input, output, and status attributes are set based on the function's parameters and return value.
* Using the tracer in a `with` clause allows you to trace specific code blocks within a function. You manually define the Span name, input, output, and status.

Check out the [docs](https://docs.arize.com/phoenix/tracing/how-to-tracing/instrument-python#using-your-tracer) for more on how to use tracer objects.&#x20;

## 12.09.2024: **Sessions** üí¨

**Available in Phoenix 7.0+**

![](https://storage.googleapis.com/arize-phoenix-assets/assets/images/s-sessions.png)

Sessions allow you to group multiple responses into a single thread. Each response is still captured as a single trace, but each trace is linked together and presented in a combined view.&#x20;

Sessions make it easier to visual multi-turn exchanges with your chatbot or agent Sessions launches with Python and TS/JS support. For more on sessions, check out[ a walkthrough video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzS6x0BE-EU) and the [docs](https://docs.arize.com/phoenix/tracing/how-to-tracing/setup-sessions?utm_campaign=Phoenix%20Newsletter\&utm_source=hs_email\&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--aSHse9NA8I5ncZzavHCp6LBXibZCgbWcRrxbh2RwugL6IQdTOSu8cz-Wqh6EO9xJLGX2E).&#x20;

## 07.11.2024: Hosted Phoenix üíª

**Phoenix is now available for deployment as a fully hosted service.**&#x20;

![](https://storage.googleapis.com/arize-phoenix-assets/assets/images/s-llamatrace.png)

In addition to our existing notebook, CLI, and self-hosted deployment options, we‚Äôre excited to announce that Phoenix is now available as a [fully hosted service](https://arize.com/resource/introducing-hosted-phoenix-llamatrace/).

With hosted instances, your data is stored between sessions, and you can easily share your work with team members.

We are partnering with LlamaIndex to power a new observability platform in LlamaCloud: LlamaTrace. LlamaTrace will automatically capture traces emitted from your LlamaIndex applications, and store them in a persistent, cloud- accessible Phoenix instance.

Hosted Phoenix is 100% free-to-use, [check it out today](https://app.phoenix.arize.com/login)!

## 07.03.2024: Datasets & Experiments üß™

**Available in Phoenix 4.6+**

**Datasets** üìä: Datasets are a new core feature in Phoenix that live alongside your projects. They can be imported, exported, created, curated, manipulated, and viewed within the platform, and should make a few flows much easier:

* Fine-tuning: You can now create a dataset based on conditions in the UI, or by manually choosing examples, then export these into csv or jsonl formats readymade for fine-tuning APIs.
* Experimentation: External datasets can be uploaded into Phoenix to serve as the test cases for experiments run in the platform.

For more details on using datasets see our [documentation](https://docs.arize.com/phoenix/datasets-and-experiments/overview-datasets?utm_campaign=Phoenix%20Newsletter\&utm_source=hs_email\&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9Tx_lYbuasbD3Mzdwl0VNPcvy_YcbPudxu1qwBZ3T7Mh---A4PO-OJfhas-RR4Ys_IEb0F) or [example notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1e4vZR5VPelXXYGtWfvM3CErPhItHAIp2?usp=sharing\&utm_campaign=Phoenix%20Newsletter\&utm_source=hs_email\&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9Tx_lYbuasbD3Mzdwl0VNPcvy_YcbPudxu1qwBZ3T7Mh---A4PO-OJfhas-RR4Ys_IEb0F).

**Experiments üß™:** Our new Datasets and Experiments feature enables you to create and manage datasets for rigorous testing and evaluation of your models. You can now run comprehensive experiments to measure and analyze the performance of your LLMs in various scenarios.&#x20;

For more details, check out our full [walkthrough](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rzxN-YV_DbE\&t=25s).&#x20;

## 07.02.2024: Function Call Evaluations ‚öíÔ∏è

**Available in Phoenix 4.6+**

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2025-02-18 at 2.45.33‚ÄØPM.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

We are introducing a new built-in function call evaluator that scores the function/tool-calling capabilities of your LLMs. This off-the-shelf evaluator will help you ensure that your models are not just generating text but also effectively interacting with tools and functions as intended.

This evaluator checks for issues arising from function routing, parameter extraction, and function generation.

Check out a [full walkthrough of the evaluator](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rsu-UZ1ZVZU).
