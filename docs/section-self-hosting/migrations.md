# Migrations

New major versions of Phoenix may contain database migrations that run automatically upon the start of the application. This process is intended to be seamless and should not require manual intervention except in exceptional circumstances.

All migrations are documented in the main [MIGRATION doc](https://github.com/Arize-ai/phoenix/blob/main/MIGRATION.md)
