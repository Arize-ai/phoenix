    Highlights issues that occur maintaining a sentiment classification model.
    This  model takes online reviews of your U.S.-based product as the input and
    predicts whether the reviewer's sentiment was positive, negative, or
    neutral.

    You trained your sentiment classification model on English reviews. However,
    once the model was released into production, you notice that the performance
    of the model has degraded over a period of time.

    Phoenix is able to surface the reason for this performance degradation. In
    this example, the presence of reviews written in Spanish impact the model's
    performance. You can surface and troubleshoot this issue by analyzing the
    embedding vectors associated with the online review text.
