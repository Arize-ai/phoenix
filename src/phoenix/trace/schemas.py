    Attributes are key-value pairs that contain metadata that you can use to
    annotate a Span to carry information about the operation it is tracking.

    Keys must be non-null string values. Values must be a non-null string, boolean,
    floating point value, integer, or an array of these values Additionally, there
    are Semantic Attributes, which are known naming conventions for metadata that is
    typically present in common operations. It’s helpful to use semantic attribute
    naming wherever possible so that common kinds of metadata are standardized
    across systems.
