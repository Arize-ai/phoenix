    "Imagine you're in charge of maintaining a model that takes as input online reviews of your U.S.-based product and classifies the sentiment of each review as positive, negative, or neutral. Your model initially performs well in production, but its performance gradually degrades over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Phoenix helps you surface the reason for this regression by analyzing the *embeddings* representing the text of each review. Your model was trained on English reviews, but as you'll discover, it's encountering Spanish reviews in production that it can't correctly classify.\n",
    "\n",
    "According to our research, embedding drift often precedes performance degradation. So Phoenix can help you proactively detect and fix this issue before it becomes noticable to your users.\n",

    "In this tutorial, you will:\n",
    "* Download curated datasets of embeddings and predictions\n",
    "* Visually explore embeddings in Phoenix\n",
