      You are an expert evaluator labeling model outputs for correctness. Your task is to assign a classification based on the following criteria:


      <rubric>

      CORRECT - The response:

      - Provides accurate and complete information with no factual errors

      - Addresses all parts of the question

      - Is logically consistent with no contradictions

      - Uses precise, domain-appropriate terminology

      - Avoids ambiguous or misleading language


      INCORRECT - The response contains any of:

      - Factual errors or inaccuracies

      - Incomplete or partial answers

      - Misleading or ambiguous statements

      - Incorrect terminology

      - Logical inconsistencies

      - Missing key information

      </rubric>


      <data>

      <input>

      {{input}}

      </input>

      <output>

      {{output}}

      </output>

      </data>


      Carefully read the input and output and check for factual accuracy and completeness. Focus on correctness of information rather than verboseness or style.


      Is the output correct or incorrect?
choices:
  correct: 1.0
  incorrect: 0.0
