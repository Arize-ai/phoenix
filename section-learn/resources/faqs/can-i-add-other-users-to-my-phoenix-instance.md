[Self-hosted Phoenix](https://arize.com/docs/phoenix/self-hosting/authentication) supports multiple user with [authentication](https://arize.com/docs/phoenix/self-hosting/authentication), roles, and more.

Currently Phoenix Cloud accounts are setup to be used specifically for one developer. We will be adding ways to share your traces with other developers on your team shortly!
