Phoenix enables you to get to MLOps insights at lightning speed. Phoenix focuses on surfacing areas
that require critical attention and offers zero-config observability for model drift, performance,
and data quality.

**_ NOTE: Phoenix is under active development. APIs may change at any time _**

## Getting started

```shell
pip install phoenix
```

## Unstructured data

Phoenix takes advantage of UMAP and HDBSCAN to highlight segments of your data that are areas of
critical drift.

## Structured / tabular data

Phoenix surfaces up problematic features of your model with regards to drift, performance, and data
quality.
